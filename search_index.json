Learn more about how to contribute.\n\nOpenMRS is an electronic medical record system (EMR) platform, designed for use in the developing world and first established in 2004. Today, the system has evolved into a medical informatics platform used on nearly every continent, supporting health care delivery and research in an extremely wide variety of contexts.\nOur world continues to be ravaged by pandemics of epic proportions, as untold millions of people are infected with diseases such as HIV/AIDS, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, malaria, and many others. Many of these infections occur in developing countries, where lack of education and resources contribute to scores of preventable deaths. Prevention and treatment interventions on this scale require efficient information management, which is particularly critical as clinical care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, lack of money, or no access to software developers, most health care programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases--if they have any electronic infrastructure at all. Most health care records in the developing world are still maintained on paper.\nAs a response to these challenges in developing countries, OpenMRS was created as a medical record platform--a rising tide which we hope will lift all ships. It is designed to offer a better tool for information management, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicate efforts. In the years since its inception, the OpenMRS community has grown from a handful of organizations to a massive collaborative effort by both groups and individuals, all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network that allows self-reliance in system development, even in resource-constrained environments.\nSince its beginning, OpenMRS has been based on the principles of openness and of sharing ideas, software and strategies for deployment and use. The system is designed to be usable in very resource-poor environments and can be modified with the addition of new data items, forms and reports without the need to write complicated application code. It is intended as a platform that organizations can adopt and modify, avoiding the need to develop a system from scratch.\nAnd indeed, organizations around the world are doing just that. OpenMRS is now in use in clinics in Argentina, Botswana, Cambodia, Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, The Gambia, Uganda, United States, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe, and many other places. This work is supported by many individuals and organizations, including international and government aid groups, NGOs, and for-profit and non-profit corporations.\nOpenMRS is not only in use in many different places, but it is also being used to meet many different needs. In Kenya, it is used to support health care delivery for hundreds of thousands of patients at a network of over 50 clinics--some connected by typical networks, but many where the connection requires offline synchronization to external storage that can be physically transported between sites. Another NGO uses a central OpenMRS server connected to clinics in multiple countries via satellite Internet connections. In Malawi, creative individuals with a talent for technology have built a mobile cart running OpenMRS that physicians roll around their clinic, interacting with the system using a touchscreen. In Rwanda, the national ministry of health has worked to roll out a connected national health care system using OpenMRS. In the United States, OpenMRS is used to track patients at large sporting events, for mobile providers of health care to homeless people, and as a personal health record that allows cancer patients to share treatment and home health care information with caregivers and family members.\nOpenMRS in use at TRAC Plus Clinic in Kigali, Rwanda.\nIn the last several years, use of mobile technology has increased dramatically, particularly in the developing world. In some developing countries, there are more mobile phones than people! Facilitated by other open source projects, OpenMRS can be integrated with SMS messaging, allowing community health workers to add information about adherence to medication regimens to a patient's record, as they make rounds through villages in rural Africa. Elsewhere, mobile phone applications are used to guide these community volunteers in home-based HIV testing and counseling, enrolling prospective patients from the comfort of their own homes.\nBesides clinical care, the platform can also be used in research settings. In the United States, OpenMRS has been used both in training medical informatics students, as well as in conducting various research projects in the fields of public health. In Peru OpenMRS is used as the research database for a large study of drug resistant tuberculosis funded by the US National Institutes of Health. Because the system has been designed as an extensible platform, it is very easy for researchers to adapt OpenMRS to do what they need.\n"},"Introduction/a-brief-history.html":{"url":"Introduction/a-brief-history.html","title":"A Brief History","keywords":"","body":"A Brief History\nOne of OpenMRS' birthplaces – Moi University Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya (2004)\n\nThroughout the 1990s, an academic partnership flourished between Indiana University School of Medicine in the United States and Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya, providing Kenyan medical students with access to health care training. This program continued to grow for several years until a severe outbreak of HIV/AIDS in Western Kenya caused the program to rethink its goals, at which point the Academic Model for Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH) was created. The number of patients in Kenya continued to grow, and basic IT systems including Microsoft Access were used to monitor patient care.\nIn February 2004, the amount of data had become too large for AMPATH's existing systems, so their medical director invited Burke Mamlin, from the Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis, United States, to visit the site and evaluate how improvements in medical informatics technology could improve AMPATH's data management. Regenstrief had long been recognized as a leader in medical informatics research, and Burke brought his colleague Paul Biondich along with him on the visit to Kenya. It quickly became apparent that a new system was needed. Paul and Burke began to design the data model for a new medical records system for AMPATH, which would go on to become OpenMRS.\nAt the same time, a Boston-based non-profit named Partners In Health (PIH) was pioneering the use of web-based EMRs in developing countries. They had built the PIH-EMR, which they were using to support the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Peru and HIV in Haiti. But Hamish Fraser, PIH's director of the EMR project, was worried: PIH was about to expand into Rwanda, Lesotho, and Malawi, and he feared it would be difficult to maintain their home-built system in 5 countries.\nIn September 2004, Paul and Burke met Hamish at the World Congress on Medical and Health Informatics (MedInfo) conference in San Francisco. It became apparent that the three shared similar goals and needs, so they agreed to work collaboratively to develop a system that would be suitable for the various needs of humanitarian work in African nations and beyond.\nPaul and Burke hired developer Ben Wolfe to begin work on programming an early prototype of OpenMRS, based on their previous work at AMPATH and Regenstrief. Several months later, PIH's lead developer Darius Jazayeri joined the project, merging PIH-EMR's functionality into the new system. The previous systems at AMPATH focused on data entry, while at PIH, the focus was more on clinical workflow. The new system combined features of both the AMPATH and PIH systems.\nBecause of the strong cooperation between PIH and Regenstrief and the long distances involved, it became clear that an open source software model of development was the best way to sustain and grow the platform, and the OpenMRS project was born.\nWhile the collaboration between Regenstrief and PIH continued and the new system was being designed, the groups were looking for additional support in Africa. They turned to their colleague Chris Seebregts, from the South African Medical Research Council (MRC). Chris was already heavily involved in the field of medical informatics throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and brought with him a wealth of knowledge about the needs of informatics implementations. Seebregts had been adapting OpenMRS for use in South Africa and started to build up a community of implementers of the software around the world. His work led to massive growth of the OpenMRS community (now nearly 2,000 strong as of late 2011). In February 2006, AMPATH launched OpenMRS in Kenya, and PIH brought it to Rwinkwavu, Rwanda, in August of the same year. The South African MRC first switched on the system at Richmond Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal at the end of 2006.\nAs both the OpenMRS application and open source community grew, they gathered the attention of many other large projects and agencies. Some of these have extended both financial and consulting support over the past several years, including:\n\nThe United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)\n\nThe United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)\n\nCanada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC)\n\nNational Institutes of Health Fogarty International Centre\n\n\n\nThe Millennium Villages Project of the Earth Institute, Columbia University\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\nIn an effort to broaden participation in the project around the world, OpenMRS began participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program in 2007. GSoC provides university students who wish to participate in open source development projects with a stipend and a close mentoring relationship with an experienced project team member. Participation in the program has continued since then--OpenMRS is now one of the larger open source projects in the program, boasting a large class of alumni, a number of whom continue to contribute to the project. Many of these alumni come from the developing world, and some have gone on to successful software development careers.\nThe inaugural OpenMRS Implementers Meeting in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nOne of the aims of the OpenMRS community is to help build local capacity in the places where it is used. To that end, participants in the community are encouraged to develop programs and processes that encourage entrepreneurship and the creation of partnerships to grow the field of medical informatics, particularly in the developing world. For example, in Kigali, Rwanda, Partners In Health jump-started a local training program known as E-Health Software Development and Implementation (EHSDI). This 9-month course conducted in partnership with the Rwanda Development Board and the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) was designed to teach students to develop medical information systems. It includes extensive training in using the OpenMRS platform.\nThe number of individual and organizational volunteers who participate in the OpenMRS community has continued to grow, tripling in size between 2010 and 2011. These individuals participate in various ways, from documentation and bug reports, from training and providing support to other community members. The release of OpenMRS 1.8 was made possible by the assistance of over 50 contributors.\nFurther, collaborations with other open source software organizations such as Open Data Kit and Pentaho have produced volunteer contributions to OpenMRS, and commercial consulting organizations such as ThoughtWorks Inc. have contributed many hours to developing and improving OpenMRS.\nAt the close of 2011, the OpenMRS community is preparing to launch an independent not-for-profit organization to help support the project's needs as it grows. The goal of this organization will be to provide technical infrastructure and community management, to assist collaboration and cooperation of project volunteers throughout the world, and to provide training and support to those who seek to implement OpenMRS as a key part of a medical informatics strategy in clinics, hospitals, and government health organizations.\nFrom its humble beginnings as a solution to a problem in a small African town, OpenMRS has become the largest open source health care project on the planet. Between 2006 and 2011, OpenMRS at AMPATH in Kenya has recorded over 111,000,000 points of data for over 180,000 patients, helping to save many thousands of lives. Every day, similar stories are retold somewhere else around the world with the assistance of thousands of volunteers. The OpenMRS community continues to grow, and we are excited that you're interesting in joining us. Regardless of your background or interests, there is a way for you to both contribute and gain from the work of others in the OpenMRS community.\nWhat's New in Version 1.9\nThis version of OpenMRS includes a new concept, Visit. A visit is comprised of at least one Encounter. Encounter has been redefined in this version as a transaction between a patient and at least one health care provider to provide service or assess a patient's health status.\nOpenMRS Attributes now allows for implementation-specific customizations of certain types of OpenMRS data. In earlier releases, only Person could be customized. Now, you can also customize Provider, Visit, and Location data.\nConcept Mapping has been improved in this release, now allowing you to define how your system's concepts relate to external concepts and standards.\n"},"Introduction/example-amani-clinic.html":{"url":"Introduction/example-amani-clinic.html","title":"Example: Amani Clinic","keywords":"","body":"Example: Amani Clinic\nWe assume if you're reading this book that you're interested in deploying OpenMRS to support clinical care in the real world.

Much of the fame of Kisiizi is based on its hydroelectric power generating station and its relatively large hospital, which handles most of the health care for the region.\nJust over two years ago, a European-based NGO provided funding to help launch a new health care facility we'll call \"Amani Clinic\" in the town. This clinic was opened specifically to address the need for maternal and child health (MCH) care in Kisiizi and the surrounding areas.\nSince its opening, the clinic has been very successful in establishing itself, and has attracted a full staff of doctors, nurses, and assistants. New patients, both pregnant women and new mothers, are continually being registered in the clinic, but there is very little information available about the efficacy of the work in the clinic, or the outcomes for its patients. Therefore, the funding agency has requested that the clinic work to implement an information system, to help better monitor and evaluate the health care outcomes of the patients over time, and to help the clinic scale up to see more patients more efficiently. The agency recommended that the clinic consider using OpenMRS, which had been successfully used by other projects funded by that agency in other countries.\nThe funding model provided for some information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to get the project started, as well as for some staffing support. However, deciding how to allocate this money was left up to the clinic's local management. After receiving the grant funding, the director of the site hired Claudine, a graduate of a medical informatics training program in neighboring Rwanda, to help lead the effort. This newly-hired informatics manager, in turn, hired Daniel, recent university graduate from Kampala with expertise in ICT infrastructure and system administration.\nSince the clinic was opened, doctors and nurses have used paper forms to collect data about their patients. These forms are stored in folders and kept in a locked file room until a patient's appointment. When the patients arrive, they are given their folder to carry with them as they talk with the various health care providers they will see during their visit. Each of these providers completes the relevant paper forms to add information about the visit. The forms are added to the patient's folder, which is returned at the end of their visit.\nClinical staff were concerned when they heard about the upcoming deployment of OpenMRC, because of the possibility of changes to the way they are used to working. However, the informatics manager has assured them that they can continue to use the familiar paper forms. When a patient arrives at the clinic, they will be registered by a patient registration clerk. After the patient's visit is complete, a data entry clerk will enter the information from that visit into OpenMRS.\nMany people in Kisiizi have basic ICT skills, and there is a local Internet cafe, supported by an NGO that provides basic ICT training to local residents. Two recent students have been hired as the first patient registration and data entry clerks for the clinic.\nMeanwhile, the system administrator has finished his preparation work and has deployed a basic local area network (LAN) to connect a server that will host the OpenMRS application to PCs in the file room, in the clinic manager's office, and in the ICT room. The LAN is connected to the Internet, although the connection isn't very fast and often goes offline. The server is powered by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), that will ensure it stays running despite any fluctuations in the local power grid.\nThrough the rest of this book, you will follow the progress of the people at the Amani Clinic as they install OpenMRS, customize it to fit the needs of their clinic, and use OpenMRS from day to day, first to enter data and then to extract it for patient visits and for reporting to their funding agency on an ongoing basis.\n"},"Planning/is-openmrs-for-you.html":{"url":"Planning/is-openmrs-for-you.html","title":"Is OpenMRS for You?","keywords":"","body":"Example: Amani Clinic\nWe assume if you're reading this book that you're interested in deploying OpenMRS to support clinical care in the real world.

It does not go into detail about what OpenMRS does or how it stores data -- you will find that in other chapters. Instead, we encourage you to first take a step back and think about your organization.\nYour organizational goals and practices\nFor now, forget about technology and instead think about your organizational goals and processes. Here's a list of questions to start:\n\nWhat are the high-level goals of your organization?\n\nWhat are the teams and staff in the clinic? What roles exist? What functions does each role perform?\n\n\n\nWhat tasks are staff involved with on a day-to-day basis?\n\nWhat services does the clinic provide to your patients? What activities are involved?\n\n\n\nWhat other 3rd-party or government organizations do you report to? What information is included in each of these reports?\n\nAnswering these questions will probably help you think of more related questions. Make sure you consider them thoroughly.\nTake advantage of institutional knowledge\nAs you think about your patients and how they interact with your organization, talk to your clinical and administrative staff--both those who have been around a long time, and those who have just joined. Talk to as many people as possible to get a complete picture of every service provided to patients.\nPeople generally want to be positive in describing their work places, so you may need to ask some people multiple times. Get physical or electronic copies, or pictures of all paper forms if possible. Figure out where (e.g., specific rooms and desks) data is recorded onto paper and by whom. Write an overview of current practices and define specific shortcomings that could be addressed by using an electronic medical records system.\nNote that practices may vary seasonally, for example if the hospital is much busier due to increased malaria during rainy season or malnutrition before harvest.\nMap your needs to OpenMRS\nOpenMRS has been designed to be flexible and adaptable, based on input from many different partners, but it may not be an exact fit for the ways that your organization currently works. Doing things the \"OpenMRS way\" could mean adapting your workflow and adopting best practices in medical informatics. Be pragmatic and flexible, and think about whether your current working practices might need to change.\nRemember that OpenMRS offers many opportunities to capture and analyze information in new ways not previously possible. Taking advantage of these new possibilities might lead to positive changes and improvements for your organization.\nDo not \"reinvent the wheel\"\nThe open source nature of OpenMRS extends beyond application itself to a much larger open community where ideas and experiences are shared. There are many existing resources available in the form of pre-built OpenMRS features (modules) and content that a new implementer should take advantage of. You should explore the following resources before building anything new.\nReuse an existing concept dictionary\nA well-constructed, mature concept dictionary (see the \"OpenMRS Information Model\" chapter) is a strong foundation for any OpenMRS Implementation.\nThe Millenium Villages Project (MVP) maintains a well-curated concept dictionary. If this dictionary is applicable to your domain of care, you should strongly consider using it. The best way to learn about this dictionary is through a partner project, the Maternal Concept Lab.\nhttp://om.rs/book-mcl\nOther OpenMRS implementers can also help advise you about other concept references for your domain. Read the \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\" chapter for more information.\nAdapt existing forms\nImplementers should evaluate data collection forms built by other OpenMRS users before creating new custom forms for their specific needs.\nImplementers across the OpenMRS community have invested a lot of resources in ensuring that their forms reflect clinical best practices, international standards, and current research. These forms have already been optimized for electronic data entry. Many OpenMRS partners develop forms using medical informatics experts that may not be available to all projects. Finally, creating forms is time consuming; those resources could be redirected to other efforts.\nThe OpenMRS Form Bank is a new community-driven project that is beginning to collect existing forms from other users. Visit Form Bank for details, or contact other implementers for help. Read the \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\" chapter for more information.\nExplore the module repository\nImplementers should consult the OpenMRS Module Repository at http://modules.openmrs.org/ before considering customization through software development.\nThere is a good chance that someone has created a module to address needs you may have. Read the \"Customizing OpenMRS with Plug-in Modules\" chapter for a list of recommended modules.\nAmani discovers their specific needs\nOnce the clinic determined they would use OpenMRS, they began thinking specifically about how they would integrate their existing processes into the workflow supported by the software. As the newly-hired medical informatics manager, Claudine knew she should speak with everyone working in the clinic and watch them during a typical day to understand how they work. When she spoke to them, she assured them that OpenMRS would help to make their work easier, and they would still be using the same overall processes they were familiar with.\nClaudine found many resources within the OpenMRS community, including pre-existing concept dictionaries and forms that had been used in other clinics. She was able to take these artifacts and adapt them to Amani's paper forms already in use. Starting out with the work of others saved quite a bit of time.\n\n"},"Planning/transitioning-to-openmrs.html":{"url":"Planning/transitioning-to-openmrs.html","title":"Transitioning to OpenMRS","keywords":"","body":"Transitioning to OpenMRS\nA paper-based patient register book at an African OpenMRS clinic.\n\nThis chapter outlines steps that typically make up a OpenMRS project, and should be read by people about to embark on a OpenMRS implementation. Some of this information may be obvious to experienced project managers. A comprehensive guide to project management is beyond the scope of this book, but we have included some high-level process considerations to get you started thinking about what needs to happen.\nWe recommend you try to build a structured implementation process. It's important to plan carefully--the decisions you make during this process require substantial investments of resources, and you will be living with your choices for the foreseeable future.\nWhen you start out on a new OpenMRS project, you should spend time thinking about (at minimum):\n\nWhich people will be involved in the project\n\nBusiness goals of using OpenMRS\n\nHow you will approach the initial configuration\n\nWhat ongoing support you will need\n\nCosts associated with ICT infrastructure\n\nTraining and documentation\n\nChange management\n\n\nPeople and the project team\nYour project implementation team should include clinic staff:\n\nManagement are aware of funding obligations and third party reporting requirements.\n\nHealth care providers are focused on improving patient care.\n\nAdministrative staff are specialists of workflow issues and clinic processes.\n\n\nThe team could also include the following people that may or may not be from the clinic:\n\nA system administrator is in charge of installing and maintaining OpenMRS inside of the clinic's ICT infrastructure.\n\nMedical informatics expert(s) create clinical documentation and ensure that data is managed properly in the system. Develop reports.\n\n(Optional) A project manager or coordinator. For larger implementations, this person works to hold people accountable to finishing their work in a timely manner, and ensures the project is on track.\n\n(Optional) Software developers may be needed for locations that decide to customize the system.\n\n\nIt is very important to include clinical staff (for example nurses, data entry clerks, and others) in your implementation team from the earliest phases of the project so that the resulting deployment is useful for them and easy for them to use.\nManaging an OpenMRS project will require a major time investment from people within your organization, even if you employ an external consultant. Organizations often underestimate the amount of time that will be required from their staff in implementing an enterprise ICT project. This time investment includes items such as training, modifying existing processes, and providing new or updated information to relevant people. Deploying OpenMRS is no different. It's not something that can be added to the end of an already busy schedule, and we urge you to keep this in mind and take it into consideration when planning.\nGoals\nBy this point in the project, you should have a good idea of what indicates a successful OpenMRS implementation for your clinic. This could be something like reducing time to prepare month-end reports by 50%, or increasing antiretroviral treatment (ART) in HIV-infected pregnant women by 25%. Your goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely--or SMART.\nThese goals will help you in directing and managing your project. For example, if the project group wants some customization that requires budget and effort, your overall goals will help you decide whether or not to consider that customization. Your goals will help you to focus on why you are implementing OpenMRS and what you want to achieve in the long run.\nIncremental adoption\nIt often makes sense to divide the implementation process into smaller, more manageable sections, which can be implemented in discrete stages or iterations. Implementing in stages allows people to get used to changes gradually without feeling overwhelmed, and allows your implementation team to be responsive to feedback from users during the process.\nAnother reason people choose to develop iteratively is that it is very hard for users to correctly or fully explain their requirements at the beginning of the project. Giving people hands-on experience of an early version of the system helps them understand how it works and what might be possible. They can then provide you with valuable feedback, and they might identify new requirements.\n\nThe Amani Clinic chose to introduce change iteratively. First they started using the system for patient registration. This affected only the administrative staff without impacting the clinical staff. Later they started doing retrospective data entry, which included paper forms for clinicians that had minor changes, as well as training a new data entry clerk.\nPilot projects\nLarger multi-site implementations may wish to develop a pilot approach to help reduce risk. In this scenario, you would only deploy OpenMRS at one site and learn about the process in a more controlled way. You can then incorporate what you've learned into a coordinated implementation process for other sites.\nOngoing support and development\nIt is a mistake to think about an OpenMRS project as a one-off installation that will meet the needs of your organization for the foreseeable future. Organizations are always changing and evolving. Your medical record system should evolve with you, otherwise it will eventually become out of sync with the organization.\nOnce you have been using OpenMRS for a while and staff are comfortable with it, you will likely want to take advantage of additional functionality. Each improvement or new piece of functionality you decide to implement in OpenMRS will take resources, so you will want to plan ahead for these.\nEven if your organizational needs don't change, you need to plan for ongoing support of OpenMRS, including:\n\nKeeping your system up-to-date with security patches\n\nUpgrading to the latest version of OpenMRS (not always necessary, but OpenMRS is continually improving usability and adding functionality)\n\nUpgrading the modules you use to fix bugs and improve features\n\nMaintenance of your server and network infrastructure\n\n\nFor more information, see the \"Maintenance\" chapter.\nTraining\nTraining is also an important part of any OpenMRS implementation project. Your training could take many forms depending on the needs of your users, but it often makes sense to spend resources (e.g., time and money) on formal and reusable training resources such as user guides, lesson plans, and other materials.\nTrying to cover everything in one training session probably won't be effective. People will want and need time to digest the new ideas they learn and use them in their daily work, and you must anticipate staff turnover. Instead, consider holding smaller training sessions that introduce concepts and specific functionality, followed by periods of testing, piloting and feedback. Customize your training for your audience--not everyone needs to sit through a two-hour training session on data entry if only a single person is responsible for this role. When possible, train people to become trainers. This increases peoples' sense of ownership in your OpenMRS implementation, and helps people to better remember what they learn.\nTraining is an ongoing process. New employees will need to be trained when they start, and people familiar with the system can benefit from learning about more advanced topics. People may need further training when there are significant upgrades or new functionality is added to OpenMRS.\nChange management\nIntroducing an electronic medical record system will cause changes in workflow and processes at your organization. These changes may be \"political\" and cause challenges in your organization, or they may be more practical and technical changes. Either way, too much change at the same time is often difficult and stressful.\nTo help, give people time to accept and support each change so that they share in ownership of the new system, rather than feeling as if something has been forced on them. Focus on simple tasks at the beginning of deployment and introduce more difficult tasks as people start to better understand OpenMRS. Show staff how the new system will make their work easier and where their feedback has been incorporated.\nGood planning can minimize the risks around change, but it is important to be flexible within your plan. Unforeseen things often occur, and a plan that is too rigid could prevent you from reaching the best solution.\n"},"Getting Started/installation-and-initial-setup.html":{"url":"Getting Started/installation-and-initial-setup.html","title":"Installation and Initial Setup","keywords":"","body":"Installation and Initial Setup\nAn OpenMRS server in Uganda.\n\nYou can download OpenMRS from the OpenMRS web site:\nhttp://download.openmrs.org\nThere are two ways to install OpenMRS: Standalone, and Enterprise. You must have Java 6 or higher installed on your system to run OpenMRS. For OpenMRS Platform 2.0+ (includes the community's Reference Application 2.5+), Java 8 or higher is required.\nOpenMRS Standalone provides a simplified installation option with an embedded database and web server. It is a great way to evaluate and explore OpenMRS, letting you get a local version up and running within minutes, and includes download options with sample data. OpenMRS Standalone should run fine for smaller installations (fewer than 10,000 patient records), but if you are setting up a larger installation, we recommend using the Enterprise installation. If you are not sure which makes sense, you can start with a Standalone installation and migrate your data to the Enterprise version later.\nOpenMRS Enterprise is appropriate for larger installations. If you already have a Java servlet container and a database installed, and you want to set up OpenMRS to use these resources, you should use OpenMRS Enterprise.\nOpenMRS Standalone\nTo install the standalone version, download the ZIP file and decompress it, then double-click the openmrs-standalone.jar file to run it. The first time you run this file, it will install OpenMRS and open your browser to the new OpenMRS instance.\nDuring setup, there is an option to install demo data. You may choose to install a demo concept dictionary, which can jump-start your form creation process.  You may also install demo patient data, which will provide a better demonstration of patient encounters and demographics.\nDo not delete or rename any files or folders after decompressing the ZIP file. These files and folders are required by the standalone installer.\nAlternatively, from the command line, you can navigate to the decompressed folder and run the following command:\njava -jar openmrs-standalone.jar\nOn Linux, you can also double-click on the file named run-on-linux.sh. If you are prompted for how to run it, just select run. Alternatively, you can use a command line shell to navigate to the decompressed folder and run the following command:\n./run-on-linux.sh\nUpgrading Standalone\nTo upgrade a copy of OpenMRS Standalone, do the following:\n\nStop the previous version of OpenMRS Standalone and exit the application.\n\nDownload and extract the most recent version of OpenMRS Standalone.\n\nCopy your database directory from the previous version to this new OpenMRS directory.\n\nCopy your openmrs-standalone-runtime.properties from the previous version to this new OpenMRS directory.\n\nInstall OpenMRS Standalone as described above. The new version of OpenMRS will run with your old data.\n\n\nLogging in\nBy default, the initial username and password are as follows:\n\nUsername: admin\n\nPassword: Admin123\n\n\nYou must immediately change the admin password after installation for security purposes. To change your password, click My Profile in the upper right of OpenMRS, and choose the Change Login Info tab. Update your password, then click Save Options. You can also change your username, and provide your real name, on this screen.\nStopping and restarting\nAs long as OpenMRS is running, you can return to the application by opening the following URL in your browser.\nhttp://localhost:8081/openmrs-standalone/\nBefore you change certain preferences, such as the port on which MySQL or Tomcat runs, you must stop the application.\nTo stop the application, use the Stop button in the user interface, or choose File > Quit. Alternatively, run the JAR file on the command line with a -stop parameter.\nYou can restart the GUI by clicking Start, or double-clicking on the JAR file again. Alternatively, you can run the JAR file with a-startparameter.\nBy default, OpenMRS runs the MySQL database on port 3316, and the Tomcat server on port 8081. To use a different port, stop the application, then change the port number in the openmrs-standalone-runtime.properties file or in the GUI, and restart. To override the port from the command line, run the JAR file with a -tomcatport or -mysqlport parameter.\nChanging the port number will change the URL used to access the application. To access the application, you can choose File > Launch Browser, or run the JAR file with a -browser parameter.\nOpenMRS Enterprise\nYou must have Apache Tomcat and MySQL installed on your system before installing the enterprise version of OpenMRS.\nDownload the Enterprise WAR package from\nhttp://download.openmrs.org\nNavigate to the Tomcat Web Application Manager and enter your Tomcat administrator credentials.\nhttp://localhost:8080/manager/html\nBrowse to the location of the openmrs.war package, and deploy it.\nThe initial setup which follows may take some time. At the end of the process, the Web Application Manager will refresh, and/openmrsshould be displayed in the list of applications. Tomcat should also start the application (Running = True).\nOpen the OpenMRS web application to complete the initial setup process.\nhttp://localhost:8080/openmrs\nGetting Started with OpenMRS Enterprise\nThe first time you run OpenMRS, the setup wizard will help you configure your installation. Follow the instructions in this wizard to set up your database and populate it with test data if necessary.\nTo change your configuration later, stop the application, edit the file openmrs-runtime.properties, and restart the application. On Windows, you can probably find this file in this location:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\YOURUSERNAME\\Application Data\\OpenMRS\nor\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\Application Data\\OpenMRS\nOn Mac OS X or Linux systems, it is probably located in this location:\n~/.OpenMRS\nor\n/usr/share/tomcatX/.OpenMRS\nAfter you have finished configuring OpenMRS, reload the application in the Web Application Manager. Open the login page, typically at this URL.\nhttp://localhost:8080/openmrs\nIf Tomcat is installed on another server or another port, replace localhost or 8080 as applicable.\nUse the administrator username and password you specified in the configuration wizard to log in. If you did not specify a username and password, try using the default username admin and password Admin123.\nUpgrading OpenMRS Enterprise\nTo upgrade a copy of OpenMRS Enterprise, do the following:\n\nUse the Tomcat Web Application Manager to stop the previous version of OpenMRS.\n\nDownload the most recent version of OpenMRS Enterprise.\n\nInstall OpenMRS as described above. The new version of OpenMRS will run with your old data.\n\n\nAmani chooses the Enterprise version\n\nAlthough Amani Clinic is small, they decided to install the Enterprise version. Claudine is very familiar with Apache Tomcat and MySQL, and decided she would like more control over the system. She installed Ubuntu Linux on the physical server, then installed Java 6, MySQL, and Tomcat. After doing so, she downloaded the openmrs.war file and installed it in the Tomcat application server. Excluding download time for the software, she was able to complete the process in less than one hour.\n"},"Getting Started/openmrs-information-model.html":{"url":"Getting Started/openmrs-information-model.html","title":"OpenMRS Information Model","keywords":"","body":"OpenMRS Information Model\nReference books line a shelf in a rural African clinic.\n\nThis chapter explains terms and concepts which are useful to understand as you install and use OpenMRS.\nData\nThe actual information you want to record in OpenMRS is called Data. Examples of Data in OpenMRS are Patients, Encounters, and Observations. To support this data, and describe its meaning, you need additional Metadata.\nWhen a user deletes a piece of data in OpenMRS, the information actually remains in the database. It is marked as voided, so that it will not show up in the interface, but it is not immediately deleted from the database. If a user deletes a piece of data by accident, an administrator canunvoid it to return it to the system. To permanently delete data from the database, an administrator must purge that data. Typically, this should never be done in a production system.\nMetadata\nThe fundamental expectation of OpenMRS's design is that you will customize it for your clinical program's use case. The system has no built-in idea of the patient's weight or seeing the patient in an outpatient visit. Instead, you can configure these things yourself, to match your project's workflow. Generally speaking, the things that you need to configure in order to describe the real patient information you will be capturing are referred to as metadata. An example of a piece of metadata is a Location that represents a hospital.\nAn administrator may also retire metadata in OpenMRS. This does not mean that the metadata is deleted, but rather that it is not intended to be used going forward. Old information that refers to the retired metadata remains valid. An administrator may unretire metadata if it becomes relevant to active use again. If no actual data refers to a piece of metadata, an administrator may purge the metadata to permanently remove it from the database.\nFor example, the hospital you refer patients to closes. Therefore, you can no longer refer patients there. This Location can now be retired in OpenMRS. This would not invalidate the fact that many patients were referred there in the past.\nConcepts and concept dictionary\nThe most important part of the system's metadata is the Concept Dictionary, which is a list of all the medical and program-related terms that you will use as questions and answers in Observations. This dictionary does not need to be complete when you begin using OpenMRS. You should expect new terms to be added and old terms to be retired as your use of the system evolves. It is better to start with a pre-populated Concept Dictionary, rather than starting from scratch yourself. See the chapter \"Sharing Concepts and Metadata\" for more details.\nEvery question you ask about a patient needs to be defined by a Concept. (For example, to record a patient's weight you need a concept like Weight in kilograms.)\nIf you want to ask a question that has a fixed set of coded answers, those answers are also Concepts. (For example, the question concept Blood Type may have 4 different answer concepts: A, B, AB, and O)\nPersons\nEvery individual who is referred to in a patient record in OpenMRS is stored in the system as a Person. These include Patients, any patient relative or caretaker, Providers, and Users.\nAll Persons have these characteristics.\nNames\nA person can have one or more names, one of which must be marked as the preferred name. The preferred name will be displayed in search results and patient screens.\nAddresses\nA person may have zero or more contact addresses. You may configure the format of these addresses for your particular locale.\nPerson Attributes\nTo support your local needs, you can define additional pieces of information about the people in your system, on top of those that are natively supported by OpenMRS. You can define the datatype of a Person Attribute, as well as any constraints on the possible values, using metadata. This metadata is called a Person Attribute Type.\nPerson Attributes are suitable for storing other information. But historical values of person attributes are not retained. For example, you should use a person attribute to record a patient's contact telephone number. This information may change, but if it does so, the system need only store the most recent value, and need not retain previous values. It is not appropriate to use a person attribute to store something like the patient's height, which is recorded at a given point in time, but can be expected to change and should be tracked as it does so.\nPatients\nAnyone who receives care in OpenMRS must be a Patient (for example, anyone who has an Encounter or who is enrolled in a Program). Every Patient must have at least one Identifier, which is explained below.\nA Patient is also a Person, meaning they must have at least one name and they may have addresses.\nPatient Identifier\nThe Patient Identifier is a medical record number assigned by your facility, used to identify and re-identify the patient on subsequent visits.\nA Patient Identifier Type defines the format of a particular kind of patient identifier. For example, you might define thatAmani ID is an identifier type that is required for every patient; the format is 2 letters followed by 6 digits and uses a particular check digit algorithm.\nA Check Digit is an extra digit that is added to the end of an identifier, and depends on the rest of the identifier. It allows OpenMRS to determine whether an identifier has been mistyped. For example using a Luhn check digit, \"1234-1\" is valid, but \"1234-5\" is incorrect. It is a strongly recommended best practice to use check digits in all patient identifiers that you assign. For more information about check digits, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit.\nRelationships\n\nA Relationship is a bidirectional link between two Persons in OpenMRS.\nThe metadata that describes a particular kind of relationship is a Relationship Type. It defines the names of each direction of the relationship. Typical Relationship Types are Parent/Child and Doctor/Patient.\nAt the Amani Clinic, it is necessary to use relationships to link a mother's patient record to the patient record of her children. One might also use relationships to record the link between a patient and their primary care provider.\nVisits\nAVisit in OpenMRS represents exactly what it sounds like: a time period when a patient is actively interacting with the healthcare system, typically at a location. The metadata differentiating different types of visits is a Visit Type. Visit Types are displayed in the user interface, and can be searched against.\nA visit contains encounters, which store more granular data about treatments or services.\nAt the Amani Clinic, a patient might typically check-in at registration, be seen by a doctor, and receives medication dispensed in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as one visit of type of Outpatient, and contain three encounters (Registration, Consultation, and Dispensing).\nEncounters\nA moment in time where a patient is seen by providers at a location, and data are captured. Generally speaking, every time you enter a form in OpenMRS this creates an Encounter. Encounters typically belong to a visit, but they may also stand alone.\nThe metadata that describes a kind of encounter is an Encounter Type. These are displayed in the user interface, and you may also search against them.\nDuring a typical  Amani Clinic Outpatient Visit, a patient checks in at registration, is seen by a doctor, and receives meds dispensed in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as one visit containing three encounters, whose types are Registration, Consultation, and Dispensing.\nProviders\nA Provider is a person who  provides care or services to patients. A provider may be a clinician like a doctor or nurse, a social worker, or a lab tech. Generally speaking, any healthcare worker that a patient can have an encounter with is a provider.\nProviders may have full records in OpenMRS as persons, or they may just be a simple name and ID number.\nLocations\nA Location is a physical place where a patient may be seen.\nLocations may have a hierarchy, for example Children's Ward might be a location within the location Amani Clinic.\nYou might also store physical areas (for example Eastern Province, or California) as Locations. You should not use locations to represent logical ideas like All District Hospitals.\nObservations\nAn Observation is one single piece of information that is recorded about a person at a moment in time.\nEvery observation has a Concept as its question, and depending on the datatype of the concept, it has a value that is a number, date, text, Concept, etc.\nMost of the information you store in OpenMRS is in the form of Observations, and most Observations happen in an Encounter. When you enter a form in OpenMRS, typically one Encounter is created with anywhere between tens or hundreds of Observations.\nNote that an individual Observation is valid only at one moment in time, and it does not carry forward. You may query the system for the last observation for pregnancy status but this does not tell you whether or not the patient is pregnant at any point after the moment of that observation.\nExamples of observations include Serum Creatinine of 0.9mg/dL or Review of cardiopulmonary system is normal.\nObservation groups\nSometimes a single Observation is not sufficient to capture an entire piece of patient information, and you need to use multiple Observations that are grouped together.\nFor example, recording that a patient had a rash as an allergic reaction to penicillin would need to be stored as two observations plus a third one that groups the previous two together:\n\nConcept = \"Allergen\", coded value = \"Penicillin\", group = (3)\n\nConcept = \"Reaction\", coded value = \"Rash\", group = (3)\n\nConcept = \"Allergic Reaction Construct\", group members = (1), (2)\n\n\nOrders\nAn Order is an action that a provider requests be taken regarding a patient.\nFor example a provider could order a Complete Blood Count laboratory panel for a patient.\nAn Order only records an intention, not whether or not the action is carried out. The results of an Order are typically recorded later as Observations.\nPrescribing a medication is a Drug Order. A drug order can be placed for a generic drug, represented by a Concept (for example, 500mg of Ciprofloxacin, twice a day). If you are using OpenMRS to manage a formulary of specific medications (i.e., Drugs in OpenMRS), you may also record Drug Orders against those. For example, a drug order might be One 500mg tablet of Ciprofloxacin, twice a day.\nAllergy lists\nOpenMRS lets you manually maintain an Allergy List for a patient, including the allergen, reaction, severity, etc.\nThis list is managed separately from Observations: observing an allergic reaction to a drug does not automatically add an Allergy to the list.\nUnlike an Observation (which happens at one moment in time), an Allergy is longitudinal data, with start and end dates.\nProblem lists\nOpenMRS lets you manually maintain a Problem List for a patient. This list is managed separately from Observations: observing that the patient has \"Diagnosis Present = Diabetes\" does not automatically add a problem to the list. Unlike an observation (which happens at one moment in time), a problem is longitudinal data, with start and end dates.\nProgram enrollments, workflows, and states\nA Program represents an administrative program or study that a patient may be enrolled in (for example, Child Nutrition Study or DOTS Tuberculosis Treatment Program).\nA Program Enrollment represents the fact that a patient is enrolled in one of these programs over a time period at a Location. This is longitudinal data with a start date and end date.\nA Program can also define administrative Workflows, and possible States the patient may have within those workflows. An Initial State is one that a patient is allowed to start in when they are first enrolled in a program. A Terminal State is one that closes the program enrollment if the patient is placed in it.\nFor example a research study on infant nutrition might have a workflow called Study Enrollment Status with the states:\n\nPatient Identified (initial)\n\nMother Consented to Study\n\nStudy Complete (terminal)\n\nLost to Followup (terminal)\n\n\nThese states are meant to represent administrative statuses, not clinical ones. For example putting a patient in a Loss to Followup state represents an official declaration and will not happen automatically even if no encounters are entered for the patient for several months.\nForms\nA Form represents an electronic form that may be used for entering or viewing data. The basic OpenMRS system does not define a specific technology for entering forms. You will need to use one of the community-developed form entry modules. See the chapter \"Data Entry\" for more details.\nThe Form Entry (Infopath) and XForms modules rely on a Form Schema, where you define which Concepts are used on the Form. The HTML Form Entry module does not require you to manage the schema.\nUsers, roles, and privileges\nA User in OpenMRS is an account that a person may use to log into the system.\nThe real-life person is represented by a Person record in OpenMRS, and a person may have more than one user account. If you want a patient to be able to view her own record in OpenMRS, then you need to create a user account and link it to the patient.\nA Role represents a group of privileges in the system. Roles may inherit privileges from other roles, and users may have one or more roles.\nA Privilege is an authorization to perform a particular action in the system. The list of available privileges are defined by the core system and by add-on modules (for example, Delete Patients and Manage Encounter Types), but you need to configure which roles have which privileges while you are configuring your system.\nThe information model in use at Amani Clinic\n\nA patient named Asaba arrives at Amani Clinic, where the registration clerk James creates her electronic record and stores her contact phone number as 312-555-7890. On paper the Nurse, Kissa, records Asaba's weight as 61.5kg and orders a pregnancy test. James enters these onto an electronic screen.\nFrom the perspective of the OpenMRS model, we have the following metadata:\n\nThe nurse, Kissa (a Provider)\nThe registration clerk, James (a User)\nContact Phone Number (a Person Attribute Type)\nWeight, in kilograms (a Concept, with class Finding and datatype Numeric)\nUrine Pregnancy Test (a Concept, with class Test)\nAmani Clinic (a Location)\nOutpatient Visit (an Encounter Type)\nOutpatient Triage Form (a Form)\n\nWhen Asaba is first seen at the registration desk, James creates the following data:\n\nA Patient (Asaba)\nA Person Attribute (type = Contact Phone Number, value = 312-456-7890).\n\nAfter Asaba sees the nurse, who gives a paper form to James, he creates more data:\n\nAn Encounter with:\n\npatient = Asaba\ntype = Outpatient Visit\nform = Outpatient Triage Form\nlocation = Amani Clinic\nprovider = Nurse Kissa\ncreator = Registration Clerk James\n\n\nAn Observation (in that encounter), of Weight in kilograms = 61.5.\n\nAn Order (in that encounter), for Urine Pregnancy Test\n\n\n"},"Getting Started/getting-around-the-user-interface.html":{"url":"Getting Started/getting-around-the-user-interface.html","title":"Getting Around the User Interface","keywords":"","body":"Getting Around the User Interface\nAn OpenMRS implementer-programmer gives a demonstration of the system as his clinic.\n\nThis chapter gives a brief overview of key parts of the OpenMRS user interface, which will be helpful as you read the chapters to follow.\nLogging in to the system\nOpenMRS runs as a web application, meaning you use it via a web browser. Before you can access any pages in the system, you need to log in. To do this the first time, you will need to know the administrator password that you chose during first-time setup. Refer to the chapter \"Installation and Initial Setup\" for those details.\n\nUsers that forget their password may reset it if they have configured a secret question and know the answer. TheSign up link is provided by theRequest Account module, if you have it installed.\nHome\nIn the default installation of OpenMRS, all users see the same home page after logging in. To customize different home pages for different types of users, you can use theRole Based Home Pagemodule.\n\nAs shown in the OpenMRS home page above, all pages allow you to:\n\nLog outand edit your profile, or\n\nChange your language for the current session.\n\n\nYou can configure the allowed languages via a setting in theAdministration > Maintenance > Settingspage.\nAdministration\nAs a system administrator or manager for an OpenMRS installation, you will frequently need to access the configuration and administration functions accessible through theAdministrationpage.\n\n\nYou can access theAdministrationpage from anywhere in the application by clicking its link in the top-right of the screen.\n\nConfiguration pages for the OpenMRS core functionality are listed in the left and center columns.\n\nConfiguration pages for functionality in add-on modules are listed in the right column.\n\nYou add/remove/start/stop add-on modules from theManage Modules page.\n\n\nViewing and creating patients\nOne of the most common actions for non-administrative users of the system is to find and open existing patient records. If the desired patient record is not found, users may be able to create new ones if they have sufficient privileges.\nYou can search for a patient by ID number. Clicking on the search result will open that patient's dashboard. If a user does not find a patient by ID number or name, you may create a new patient.\n\nPatient dashboard\nData entry staff will spend a lot of time on the patient dashboard page. This gives access to different parts of a patient's record and allows you to enter forms into the record.\n\nThe workflow of the patient dashboard page is not efficient for a clinician who wants to access a patient's record at the point of care. To support those workflows you should consider downloading and installing the Clinical Summarymodule or theHTML Form Flowsheetmodule.\nThe patient dashboard page is described in more detail in the chapter entitled \"The Patient Dashboard In Depth\".\n"},"Configuration/customizing-openmrs-with-plug-in-modules.html":{"url":"Configuration/customizing-openmrs-with-plug-in-modules.html","title":"Customizing OpenMRS with Plug-in Modules","keywords":"","body":"Customizing OpenMRS with Plug-in Modules\n\nOpenMRS has a modular architecture, which allows special functionality to be easily added or removed from the system. Modules have full access to the system and can modify or enhance the behavior of the system. For example, the Sync module adds the ability for an OpenMRS server to synchronize its data with other OpenMRS servers; the HTML Form Entry module provides a way to create web-based forms for collecting data; and the Flowsheet module adds a new way for viewing information. Modules also provide a mechanism for adapting OpenMRS to local needs. For more information about published modules visit the OpenMRS Wiki:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Modules/\nModule repository\nYou can view available modules in the OpenMRS Module Repository:\nhttp://modules.openmrs.org/\nIt is a place where you can find published modules. Each module has a page with a description, a link for downloading, and a link to the module's documentation.\nSome modules may be under development, but not yet published in the module repository. Many of these can be seen by browsing GitHub for repositories starting with \"openmrs-module-\" in their name. Many community modules can be found under the OpenMRS organization on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/openmrs/\nManaging modules\nYou can see available modules under Administration page, Manage Modules. The listing contains all the installed modules. You can see their status (if they are started, stopped or failed to start) as well as uninstall them.\n\nTo uninstall a module:\n\nStop the module\n\nStart the module\n\nUninstall the module\n\n\nA module is distributed as a single file with the .omod extension. You can install it from the dedicated Manage Modules section on the Administration page.\nYou can either point to a local path to the .omod file or find and install a module directly from the Install from Module Repository section which connects to the module repository.\n\nTo install a module:\n\nChoose a file and click Upload\n\nSearch for a module by name\n\nInstall the chosen module\n\n\nIf uploads are not allowed from the web, you can copy the .omod file into the folder:\n~/.OpenMRS/modules\n(where ~/.OpenMRS is assumed to be the Application Data directory which the running OpenMRS is currently using. You can find the exact location under Administration > Module Properties.) After moving the file to that location, restart OpenMRS. The module will be loaded and started.\nBundled modules\nOpenMRS is delivered with some bundled modules which are included in a standard installation. The list may differ from version to version. Some examples:\nHTML Form Entry\nAllows anyone with basic HTML programming skills and knowledge of the OpenMRS system to create forms which can be entered without any proprietary tools directly from a web browser. It is a preferred form entry module. HTML Forms allow a lot of control over the form's layout. \nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML+Form+Entry+Module\nXForms\nAllows data entry to be done directly from any JavaScript enabled browser. The module converts an OpenMRS form to an XForm. XForms are well suited to forms that will be filled out on mobile devices.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/XForms+Module\nHTML Widgets\nProvides a set of reusable HTML form field widgets that encapsulate the common input requirements for OpenMRS. It is meant to be something that developers can utilize in their code.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML+Widgets+Module\nReporting\nProvides a feature-rich and user-friendly web interface for managing reports within OpenMRS.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Reporting+Module\nReporting Compatibility\nContains pages and features that were previously included into OpenMRS core code itself and are needed to run the Reporting module. It was written for the 1.5 and later releases of OpenMRS.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/ReportingCompatibility+Module\nOther popular modules\nClinical Summary\nAllows you to create clinical summaries.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Clinical+Summary+Module\nGroovy\nWas created as a proof of concept (for embedding Groovy into OpenMRS) and to serve as a base module for other modules that want to use Groovy scripting as well.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Groovy+Module\nHTML Form Flowsheet\nAllows you to generically model a paper flowsheet. Provides basic functionality for embedding small HTML Forms inside of larger HTML Forms, where each small HTML Form represents one row in a patient chart. Additionally, the module allows you to specify any number of tabs in a tab-based layout, each containing a distinct HTML Form.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HtmlFormFlowsheet+Module\nHTML Form Entry Designer\nWYSIWYG Form Designer for the HTML Form Entry module.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML+Form+Entry+Designer+Module\nID Generation\nProvides a facility for managing identifier generation and allocation within an OpenMRS implementation. Introduces different identifier generation strategies including automatic and pooled.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Idgen+Module\nMetadata Sharing\nAllows all kinds of metadata (concepts, HTML forms, locations, roles, programs, etc.) to be exchanged between different OpenMRS installations.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Metadata+Sharing+Module\nRequest Account\nAllows users to request their own accounts, specifying their own preferred username and preferred password. An administrator can then approve or deny pending account requests.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Request+Account+Module\nREST Webservices\nExposes the OpenMRS API as REST web service.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Services+API+For+Clients\nRole-based Home Page\nAllows for administrators to define a custom \"home page\" for each defined role within the system. These home pages may be simply pages that already exist, and which particular users would be best served to have as their default. For example, system administrators may want the Administration page as their default home. Alternatively, administrators can \"author\" new pages within the running application for their users.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Role+Based+Homepage+Module\nSynchronization\nFits in scenarios when you have multiple sites using OpenMRS with separate databases and you want them to copy data to each other that will keep them synchronized.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Sync+Module\nWriting your own module\nThis section covers basics of writing your own module. We encourage to contribute modules you write to the Module Repository. You can also use our code repository for your module. For more information, please visit this page\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Creating+Modules\nIn order to develop and test a module, you will need to have OpenMRS installed in a version on which you want to run your module.\nIt is best to use a dedicated Maven archetype to create a new module. Before you start you will need to install Maven. See the Maven web site at http://maven.apache.org/ for more instructions.\nThe next step is to update the settings.xml file to point Maven to the Maven Module Archetype. You can find the file in one of the following locations:\n\nLinux: ~/.m2\n\nWindows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\user_name.m2\n\nWindows Vista/7: C:\\Users\\user_name.m2\n\n\nIf the settings file does not exist you need to create one. Add the following content:\n\n\n  \n    org.openmrs.maven.plugins\n  \n  \n    \n      OpenMRS\n      \n        true\n      \n      \n        http://mavenrepo.openmrs.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/content/archetype-catalog.xml\n      \n      \n        \n          openmrs-repo\n          OpenMRS Nexus Repository\n          http://mavenrepo.openmrs.org/nexus/content/repositories/public\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          openmrs-repo\n          OpenMRS Nexus Repository\n          http://mavenrepo.openmrs.org/nexus/content/repositories/public\n          \n            false\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nMaven is a command line tool, so open a console and enter the folder in which to create a project for your new module. The command you need to run is:\nmvn module-wizard:generate\nFollow the steps of the wizard by answering the questions. At the end, a new Maven project will be generated. To build it you just need to enter the project folder and run:\nmvn install\nYou will find the produced .omod file for your module in the directory omod/target.\nDeveloping a module requires from you to be familiar with the Spring framework. Read the Spring web site at http://www.springsource.com/for more details. There are also a few things specific to the OpenMRS platform which you will need to remember:\n\nThe Spring web context file can be found at omod\\src\\main\\resources\\webModuleApplicationContext.xml.\n\nModules are able to add and modify tables in the OpenMRS database. The files omod\\src\\main\\resources\\sqldiff.xml and omod\\src\\main\\resources\\liquibase.xml hold the SQL commands which can be executed as a module is installed.\n\nModules can extend OpenMRS core JSP pages via extension points. A module registers an extension in omod\\src\\main\\resources\\config.xml for each extension point in the system to which it wants to add content.\n\n\nYou should find extension points in the JSP pages you want to extend. Look for:\nIt is best to learn by example, so you should look at some other modules in the OpenMRS code repository for code snippets to reuse in your own work. Consider examining the Webservices.rest module.\n"},"Configuration/managing-concepts-and-metadata.html":{"url":"Configuration/managing-concepts-and-metadata.html","title":"Managing Concepts and Metadata","keywords":"","body":"Managing Concepts and Metadata\nHaving well-defined concepts is crucial for every OpenMRS installation. OpenMRS is delivered with just a few basic concepts and it is up to you to gather the rest.\nCreating concepts is a complex task which requires expertise and experience so we do not recommend doing it on your own. It is best to contact our community and use some of existing concept dictionaries like MVP or MCL. For more information on how to get in touch with the right people, see the Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community chapter.\nYou can either enter concepts on your own manually or use a tool like the Metadata Sharing Module to import them. In this chapter, we will present how to enter concepts manually via the web interface.\nConcept class\nTo start with you will need to setup Concept Classes. The standard installation includes around 15 predefined concept classes. To view them enter the Administration page > Manage Concept Classes.\n\n\nAdd a new Concept Class\n\nClick to edit an existing Concept Class\n\n\nYou will see a list with names and descriptions. You can edit them by clicking on a name and also delete by selecting check-boxes next to their names. Note that you cannot delete concept classes that are used in concepts already. There is also a link Add Concept Class to enter new ones.\nConcept datatype\nConcept Datatypes are purposed to indicate different formats of data stored in concepts. They are predefined and read-only. You can view them under Administration > Manage Concept Datatypes.\n\nConcept\nTo view concepts available in your system click Dictionary in the top menu. You will be able to search for particular concepts by name or ID. There is also a check-box that allows to search for retired concepts which are not supposed to be used anymore or are replaced with new ones. You can also enter a new concept from here clicking Add new Concept.\n\n\nOpen concept dictionary\n\nAdd a new concept\n\nSearch for concepts\n\nSearch results\n\n\n\nLet's create a concept to represent ANTENATAL VISIT REASON. We will use it later in the book in a data entry form. The form for creating a concept allows you to enter Fully Specified Name as well as synonyms. You can add synonyms with Add Synonym button [2]. At least one of the names needs to be marked as Preferred with the radio button next to it.\nWhile creating a new concept you need to decide on datatype. In this case it will be a coded concept that is you will provide a list of answers. Answers need to be defined as concepts. You need to create them beforehand or else add them later.\n\n\nSwitch between languages\n\nAdd a synonym\n\nSelect datatype\n\nEdit a list of answers (this section changes depending on the chosen datatype)\n\nAdd mappings\n\n\nConcept mapping\nConcept Mappings are added to facilitate managing concept dictionaries and point to other concepts which have the same meaning. Mappings are useful when you need to receive or send information to external systems, letting you define how your system's concepts relate to external concepts such as standardized medical vocabularies (e.g., ICD, LOINC, SNOMED). \nFor example, add a mapping to a concept in the MCL dictionary. You can save the concept now and create some answers.\nRepeat the steps and create the concepts PLANNING PREGNANCY and CURRENTLY PREGNANT of Class Finding and Datatype Boolean. The last possible answer will be OTHER of Class Misc and Datatype N/A. After creating three new concepts, you can edit ANTENATAL VISIT REASON and add them as answers.\nConcept drug\nTo view Concept Drugs, go to Administration > Manage Concept Drugs. You can either enter a concept drug by clicking its name to edit it, or you can create a new one through the Add Concept Drug link. You must enter a name and choose one of the concepts of datatypeDrug.\nMetadata\nThere are different types of Metadata which need to be managed. The list includes Locations, Encounter Types, Order Types, etc. You can view and edit them easily via the Administration page.\nPatient identifier\nA patient identifier is any unique number that can identify a patient. Examples are a Medical Record Number, a National ID, a Social Security number, a driver's license number, etc. A patient can have any number of identifiers. The Patient Identifier Type table defines what type of identifiers are collected in your system.\nA patient can have multiple identifiers of each type defined in your system. For example, a patient could have five identifiers of type of \"Medical Record Number\" because they were seen at five different hospitals that collected five different types of IDs.\nThe patient search screen searches across all identifier that are still active for a patient.\nNew identifier types are generally created if they have different characteristics. For example, one identifier can be only a string of numbers, another is a number with a hyphen plus a check digit, etc.\nIdentifiers uniquely identify patients within the system. Different types of identifiers are distributed by various health care systems. Some of these systems will be within your control, so you will be able to control how identifiers are created and distributed; however, there will likely be identifiers that are not within your control but are useful to record within your system to aid in patient identification.\nIn order to see predefined identifier types, or to add a new one, go to Administration - Manage Identifier Types. Let's examine OpenMRS Identification Number.\n\nThe Regex Format and Description of format fields are empty, but you could add here a regular expression to validate each entered identifier. For example:\n\\d{1,8}-\\d\nwould allow 1 to 8 digits followed by a dash and a single digit.\nIt is also possible to choose one of several pre-defined Identifier validators. Here Luhn CheckDigit Validator is used. The purpose of check digits is simple. Any time identifiers (typically number +/- letters) are being manually entered via keyboard, there will be errors. Inadvertent keystrokes or fatigue can cause digits to be rearranged, dropped, or inserted. \nCheck digits helps to reduce the likelihood of errors by introducing a final digit that is calculated from the prior digits. Using the proper algorithm, the final digit can always be calculated. Therefore, when a number is entered into the system (manually or otherwise), the computer can instantly verify that the final digit matches the digit predicted by the check digit algorithm. If the two do not match, the number is refused. The end result is fewer data entry errors.\nInternationalization\nConcepts can be easily internationalized; that is you can enter different concept names for every allowed locale. The list of allowed locales is stored in a setting locale.allowed.list as comma separated language codes (for instanceen,fr, orde). You can edit the setting from Administration > Maintenance > Settings. See this link for the full list of ISO 639.2 language codes:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Localization+and+Languages\nCurrently, metadata cannot be internationalized.\n"},"Configuration/sharing-concepts-and-metadata.html":{"url":"Configuration/sharing-concepts-and-metadata.html","title":"Sharing Concepts and Metadata","keywords":"","body":"Sharing Concepts and Metadata\nWorking with OpenMRS forms at Hôpital Albert Schweitzer, Deschapelles, Haiti.\n\nInstead of creating concepts, forms and other metadata yourself, you are highly encouraged to use some which are publicly available. You can use complete concept dictionaries like MCL or MVP as well as metadata packages which include just a fraction of dictionaries, forms, locations, etc.\nSharing forms entails sharing associated concepts and other metadata. To facilitate this task, the Metadata Sharing module was created. It allows all kinds of metadata (concepts, forms, locations, roles, programs, etc.) to be exchanged between different OpenMRS installations.\nAny dependent metadata will be packaged along with the exported item. For example, if you export a concept which has coded answers, the module will package the initial concept along with all the coded answer concepts, class and datatype. If you export a form, it will package the form along with the encounter type, all concepts used on that form, etc.\nThe import process is designed in a way to help identify items in your system that are semantically the same as the ones included in a package so that you can skip importing them and use yours.\nYou can find some published forms at:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Form+Bank\n\nLet's see an example of importing a form with the Metadata Sharing module. The Amani Antenatal History form will be presented in detail in the \"Data Entry\" chapter.\nAfter installing the Metadata Sharing module, go to Administration > Import Metadata.\n\n\nImport a new package\n\nSee a list of previously imported packages you are subscribing\n\n\nTo start, click the Import package button and on the next screen, point to a file you want to import.\n\n\nChoose a local file you want to import\n\nEnter a subscription URL\n\n\n\nThe next step is to choose a trust level. As stated before, while importing a package you will have a chance to use concepts, locations, etc. which exist in your system rather than creating new ones from the package. If you choose to do so, you can either overwrite your existing items or keep the ones you already have. If you choose Require Confirmation, you will be asked to review most of the metadata before importing and decide what you want to do. The Trust Incoming option in most cases will default to overwrite your existing metadata and will not require confirmation. Click Next to proceed.\n\n\nItems needing assessment\n\nItems to be created\n\nItems to skip\n\nItems in your system which will be used instead\n\nItems which will be overwritten\n\nOpens the assessment screen\n\nAll items in the package\n\n\nOn the next screen, you will see some details about the package and clicking Next again will bring you to the Import Summary page where you can assess items. As in our example, you will have to review twenty-nine concepts.\n\nThe assessment screen depending on the case allows you to choose Create New, Skip if Possible, Choose Existing - Keep Mine, and Choose Existing - Overwrite. If you select Choose Existing you will be able to search for an existing item on your system by clicking Choose replacement. In this example, you cannot select Create New as it would violate a restriction that there cannot be two concepts in the system with the same name.\nOnce reviewing all the items which need to be assessed, you can import the package.\nA good source of concepts is the Maternal Concept Lab:\nhttp://www.maternalconceptlab.com\nIt allows you to find concepts you need and download them as metadata packages. You can then import them directly to your OpenMRS installation as needed with the help of the Metadata Sharing module.\nThe Metadata Sharing module promotes decentralized management of metadata where everyone can both create and import metadata packages.\n"},"Configuration/configuring-visits.html":{"url":"Configuration/configuring-visits.html","title":"Configuring Visits","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Visits\nA patient may receive several kinds of care and services while at a health clinic. For example, they may see a clinician, have an X-ray taken, and be given a lab test. Each of these services is an Encounter, recorded in a form. OpenMRS uses Visits to collect these related encounters into one group.\nVisits are managed in Administration > Visits. Here you can define the kinds of visits and their attributes, and set the default behavior for how visits are created.\nManage Visit Types\nA Visit Type is a name and description of a kind of visit. Every visit has a type. You should create visit types that match how your health site classifies visits, such as \"Outpatient,\" \"Hospitalization,\" \"Dental,\" \"Patient Education,\" or \"TB Clinic.\"\nManage Visit Attribute Types\nIf you wish to record extra information about visits, you can create Visit Attributes and assign them to Visit Types. For example, you might create attributes for \"Followup Visit,\"or \"Distance Patient Traveled.\"\nConfigure Visits\nThere are several settings for the Visit feature.\n\nVisit is enabled by default, but is an optional feature. While Visit is enabled, the patient dashboard will show a tab called Visits and group all encounters by visit. If disabled, the patient dashboard will show the Encounters tab and list encounters chronologically with no grouping.\nA visit has a start time and an end time. The start date and time is automatically set when a visit is created. The end date and time is left blank by default. It is set manually by a data clerk. \nThe Start auto close visits task option changes this. If enabled, auto-close will automatically set the end date to the start date, and the end time to 23:59. \nAuto-close is useful for visit types that never last more than a day, such as outpatient or dental visits, or where the exact end time isn't important. Auto-close is not recommended for visit types that last multiple days, such as hospitalization, or where an exact duration might be important, such as an emergency room visit.\nThe Encounter Visit Handler controls visit creation and encounter assignment when an encounter is created. The default option will automatically link the encounter to a matching visit, or create one if none exists. To match, a visit must be at the same location, and the encounter dates must be between the visit start and end times. The second option assigns an encounter to a matching Visit if one exists, but does not create a new one. The third option will not assign encounters to anything.\nThe Encounter Visit Handler will only affect new encounters, and only while enabled. It does not affect existing visits. If you turn the feature off, or if you upgrade from an earlier version of OpenMRS,  it will not retroactively create visits.\n"},"Collecting Data/the-patient-dashboard-in-depth.html":{"url":"Collecting Data/the-patient-dashboard-in-depth.html","title":"The Patient Dashboard In Depth","keywords":"","body":"The Patient Dashboard In Depth\nThe Patient Dashboard is the place to view or edit a patient record, and add new Visits and Encounters.\nThe Patient Dashboard appearance may be changed by modules.

This is done from the Find/Create Patient link on the top menu.\n\nCreating patients is explained in the Registering Patients chapter.\nHeader\n The header bar appears at the top of the dashboard. It contains a summary of some patient details:  name, ID number, gender, age and birthdate, weight, and regimen. There will be a link to any visit in progress.  If no visits are in progress, one can be begun with the Start Visit button.\n\nOverview Tab\nThe Overview tab on the Patient Dashboard.\n\nThe Overview tab gives access to several patient features. \nIf a patient is a member of any Program (configured in Administration > Programs), it will be displayed here.\nThe Exit Patient from Care button in the Patient Actions section will end the patient's participation in any program.\nThe Relationships tab shows relationships between the Patient and other patients, providers, or users in the OpenMRS installation. The default relationship types include parent-child, sibling, doctor-patient, and aunt/uncle-niece/nephew. You can add relationship types in Administration > Person > Manage Relationship Types.\nAllergies are listed in the Allergies box.\nUse the Problem List to highlight ongoing health problems.\nRegimens Tab\nThe Regimens tab on the Patient Dashboard.\n\nThe Regimens tab shows a patient's current and completed treatment regimens. \nVisits/Encounters Tab\nThe Visits/Encounters tab on the Patient Dashboard.\n\nThe Visits tab shows all of the patient's encounters, grouped into visits.

This is the simplest and most straightforward approach to data entry. It is supported by the HTML Form Entry module, which is included with the default distribution of OpenMRS. \nBasic HTML form structure\nEvery HTML form must have the following minimal elements:\n\n    Date of encounter:  \n    Health center:  \n    Clinician's name:  \n...\n    Name of observation:  \n    \n\n\nForm header\nIt is easiest to leave these essential elements in a form header section that you re-use at the top of each form. The mandatory observation element is included below.\n\nCase study: Amani Clinic\n\nThe clinicians at the Amani Clinic needed a way to capture patient history as part of their maternal and child health (MCH) program. They had been in contact with the Millenium Villages Project (MVP) via the OpenMRS implementers mailing list. MVP staff shared their Antenatal Visit form. The implementation team decided to use the History section from the MVP form as a basis for their MCH history form.\nThe MVP Antenatal History section looked like this:\n\nStep 1: Identify and create concepts\nBefore you create a form, you must ensure that all reference concepts are present in the concept dictionary. Because the MVP team already had a concept dictionary, the Amani Clinic were able to import the concepts they needed. If you don't have access to an appropriate concept dictionary, you can also create new concepts directly, following the steps outlined in the chapter Managing Concepts and Metadata.\nThe MVP form included fourteen different Question Concepts, as well as Answer Concepts for [1], [3], [6], [9], [11], [13], and [14].\n\nStep 2: Create the form\nTo create a form, click on the Manage HTML Forms link on the Administration page.\n\nClickNew Form.\n\nEnter the basic form information and click Save.\n\nStep 3: Create visual form structure with HTML\nHTML forms allow you to create a structure that closely resembles your paper forms, although it may not be precisely the same.\nThe degree to which your form resembles the paper form depends on your HTML layout skills--all HTML tags are supported. Table layout is beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many resources available online.\nThis is the basic structure of the example HTML form, with a placeholder label inserted for each observation:\n\nStep 4: Insert observation elements\nNext, insert a form tag for each observation in your forms. These obs tags are not HTML tags, but are required by OpenMRS. The following sections provide examples of each concept datatype used on the example form. The HTML Form Entry module provides a wide variety of other tags. Please consult the HTML Form reference on the wiki for full documentation along with other examples.\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML+Form+Entry+Module+HTML+Reference\nNote: The Concept Identifier numbers used in this example will not match the Concept Identifiers in your local OpenMRS instance.\nExample 1: Date observation\n\nTo insert a Date Observation, include the Question Concept ID of any date-based Concept. The formatting label behind the Date Box cannot be removed.\n\n    \n        \n            Last Menstrual Period:\n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nExample 2: Boolean observation\n\nTo insert a Boolean observation, include the question concept ID of any boolean concept.

Depending on the datatype, you can limit this to a numeric or date range, or to specific coded answers. You can also choose which observations you are looking for (first, last, min, max, any, none) or combine (average), and you can specify date ranges.\nThis example will build a cohort of patients whose last systolic blood pressure measurement was above 130 mmHg:\n\nYou can also search for any observations that have your chosen concept as an answer. (You'd typically use this for doing a highly selective search, which you'll later filter down to something more specific.)\nIn this example we search for patients who have any observation whose answer is Hypertension, which might include both confirmed diagnoses of hypertension as well as consults to rule out Hypertension:\n\nSearching by demographics\nSelect the Patient Attributes tab to search based on simple demographic characteristics: gender, age, birthdate, and vital status.\nIn this example, we search for living male patients between 45 and 65 years old: \n\nSearching by encounters\nSelect the Encounters tab to search for patients based on encounters they have had.

You can find further documentation on the OpenMRS Wiki:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Reporting+Module\nThis chapter follows after the ones on Data Entry, because you cannot actually build reports without some data to run them on. But while planning the project you should follow the best practice of determining whatoutputs you want, and working backwards from there to determine the minimal set of data that you need to collect to produce those outputs.\nBackground and terminology\nThe reporting module is built around the idea of Definitions that are evaluated to produce output.\nReports and data sets\nIn general a Report Definition can have multiple Data Set Definitions. When run, this will produce a report with multiple data sets, which is rendered to a format chosen by the user.\nCohorts\nAlmost all reports produced with OpenMRS refer to groups of patients. A report may be run on different patient groups, or require identifying or counting sub-groups of patients. The module lets you define cohort queries (as discussed in the chapter \"Cohort Builder\"). When the report is run, these queries will be evaluated to produce actual cohorts of patients.\nIndicators\nIn this chapter, we look at a report that is based on Indicators, and specifically indicators that look at the count of patients in a cohort in a period of time.\nParameters and mapping\nUnlike in the OpenMRS Cohort Builder, reports and their underlying queries are intended to be created once, and reused. To support this idea, reports and queries usually take parameters. For example, a report intended to be run monthly would have Start Date and End Date parameters, and the user would be asked for these when they generate the report.\nThe underlying queries in the report also typically take parameters. If the report is going to display the number of patients enrolled in the Child Nutrition Study at the end of a given month, it would need to have an underlying Cohort Query for \"patients enrolled in Child Nutrition Study on a date.\" p;[/0\" +{}hat date would be an Effective Date parameter.\nWhen the user runs the report, they are asked for a Start Date and an End Date, but they are not asked to specify an Effective Date. When designing the report, you will need to define how parameters in the underlying queries obtain their values, based on the values provided by the user when running the report. This process is called mapping.\nThe idea of mapping parameters is complicated. The following resources include more information about why it is necessary, and how to do it:\n\nhttp://om.rs/bookmapping\n\nhttp://om.rs/bookmapvid\n\n\nAmani Clinic's weekly report\n\nBefore adopting OpenMRS, Amani Clinic used to spend significant time at the end of every month tabulating paper registers and patient charts to produce a monthly report for the Ministry of Health. When planning their OpenMRS implementation, they decided that to improve their program, they needed more immediate feedback. The clinic and Ministry of Health met and decided on five indicators on which they wanted a report every week. They modified their paper data collection forms to make sure that they were capturing the right data to produce those indicators, as well as the periodic Ministry of Health reports.\nWe'll focus on two of the indicators they calculated:\n\nNumber of female patients seen during the week, and\n\nThe percentage of those who were >16 years old, not pregnant, and using appropriate family planning \n\n\nDefining the Underlying Cohort Queries\nCalculating the first of those indicators was very straightforward: they defined this to be any female patient having an encounter between the start and end of the week.\nThe second indicator was more complicated: they had to break down both the numerator and the denominator into multiple cohort queries. For the denominator they needed:\n\nNot pregnant (\"no obs for Estimated Date of Confinement with a value in the future\")\n\nFemale\n\nAge > 16 at the end of the week\n\nHad an encounter during the week (same as the query for the first indicator)\n\n\nThe numerator required just one more cohort query, for patients who self-reported use of contraceptive methods other than \"Natural Planning / Rhythm\" during the week.\nBuilding the report in the user interface\nHaving determined how to calculate their indicators, they proceeded to build them in the Reporting module's user interface. First, they built the low-level queries [1]. They then composed the two indicator definitions [2] from those cohort queries. Finally, they created a report definition [3] that included the two indicators.\n\nBuilding cohort queries\nThe Cohort Query management page shows you the different types of queries available. Clicking on any of the[+]links lets you create a new query of that type.\n\nThe simplest query built by Amani Clinic included only female patients:\n\nThe rest of the queries needed to include parameters. For example, the query to find patients with any encounter between two given dates, the \"on or after\" and \"on or before\" fields were set as a Parameter [1] and user-friendly names \"Start Date\" and \"End Date\" were provided.\n\nSome of the queries built in this example included parameters that were not directly equivalent to the Start Date and End Date of the report. The \"not pregnant\" query was a Date Observation Query that included a single parameter, which they later mapped to the End Date of the report.\n\nCombining cohort queries\nAfter Amani Clinic staff created the underlying queries that their report required, they built several Composition Cohort Queries to tie them together. The most complicated query calculated the denominator of the second indicator, \"non-pregnant women, age > 16, seen during the week.\"\nThis is their composition query, which includes the two parameters Start Date and End Date. It includes four underlying queries, with values in those queries mapped to these two parameters. Finally, the queries are combined with AND to run them all together. \n\nHere, we see the seven cohort queries they built:\n\nIndicators\nHaving built cohort queries to do the underlying calculations, they used these to build the two indicators. The Indicators page is accessed from the Manage Report Definitions section of the Administration page.\nSince indicators are generally calculated over a time period, at a particular location, the indicators they created contain the default Start Date, End Date, and Location parameters. (Since the Amani Clinic was only managing a single site in OpenMRS, they ignored the Location parameter.)\nCount indicators\nThe simplest type of indicator is a Count indicator, which counts the number of patients who match a cohort query.\nThey used a Count indicator to build their first indicator, shown below. The underlying cohort query is a composition query including \"Females\" and \"Any Encounter Between Dates.\" \n\nFraction indicators\nThe most useful type of indicator for monitoring program progress is the Fraction indicator, which takes two cohort definitions, representing a numerator and a denominator, and displays this as a fraction. (It ensures that the numerator patients are a subset of the denominator.)\nAmani Clinic built their second indicator as a fraction indicator. The underlying cohort query for the numerator was a simple Coded Observation Query, while the denominator was the Composition Query described above.\n\nPeriod indicator report\nHaving created their indicators, they built a report that combined them. They used a Period Indicator Report, which is a simple way to show the indicators you have already defined.\n\nRunning the report\nTo run this report, the Amani Clinic data manager clicks the Reporting link on the top of the screen and selects the Program Monitoring Report. They must enter the start and end date of the week for which to generate the report.\n\nThe output of the report includes clickable links to the lists of patients matching each indicator.\n\n"},"Using Data/patient-alerts-and-flags.html":{"url":"Using Data/patient-alerts-and-flags.html","title":"Patient Alerts and Flags","keywords":"","body":"Patient Alerts and Flags\nIt's important to actively use your data to provide feedback to users of the system, both for clinical purposes and data quality purposes. One way to do this is with the Patient Flags module, which can display Flags on a patient dashboard when certain criteria are met, and to find all patients that match a set of criteria. We will briefly describe this module here, but you can find further documentation at the following location:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Patient+Flags+Module\nUsing this module requires significant technical knowledge. This chapter assumes that you are familiar with CSS, SQL, Groovy/Java, and the OpenMRS API.\nFirst, you need to install Patient Flags module from the OpenMRS module repository, and then go to its section on the Administration page. First, define categories of alerts [1]. Then, you can define logic and messages for these alerts [2].\n\nCategorizing flags by priorities\nFrom the Manage Priorities link, you can define different categories of alerts, each of which can be decorated with custom CSS.\nIn this example we define two different categories of alerts, the more critical of which will be highlighted in orange, and the other in gray. Note that you need to include thestyle=\"...\" in your style property.\n\nDefining flags\nTo set up a flag, you need to define a calculation that returns the cohort of patients for whom the flag should be shown. There are multiple ways to do this, each requiring a different type of technical knowlege.\nAll flags, regardless of how they are calculated, let you specify text and a Priority. The text is displayed on a patient dashboard for patients to whom the flag applies, and the Priority controls the formatting of the flag if displayed.\nFinally, you can decide whether flags are Real-Time, which means that the flags to be displayed are calculated whenever you view a patient dashboard. If you don't make a flag real-time, you can still execute the flag calculations on demand as a batch.\nSQL flags\nThe calculation behind this type of flag is a SQL statement that will be executed against the database, and must include a select (something).patient_id ... statement. The results of this query will be intersected with all non-voided patients to produce the Cohort for the flag.\nMany system administrators know how to write SQL queries, and over time they become familiar with the OpenMRS data model, making this type of flag very accessible. At the same time, writing this type of flag can be error-prone. There is nothing to prevent you from omitting a clause, such as to ensure you are only looking at non-voided data.\nIn this example we are searching for all patients who have carried at least 4 pregnancies.\nSince SQL flags must include .patient_id in their select clause, we have to join the obs table against the patient table, even though we aren't using that table.\n\nGroovy flags\nThe most powerful type of flag allows you to write Groovy or Java code, which can call OpenMRS's Java API and perform complex calculations on patient data. The advantage of writing flags in Groovy is that the OpenMRS API takes care of details like ensuring you are only getting non-voided data. The limitation is that most managers of OpenMRS systems do not know how to write Groovy/Java code.\nA Groovy flag returns a cohort of all patients that match the calculation. In this example we find all patients who are expected to give birth in the next 3 months, but who have_not_had an encounter in the last 3 months.\n\n"},"Administering OpenMRS/user-management-and-access-control.html":{"url":"Administering OpenMRS/user-management-and-access-control.html","title":"User Management and Access Control","keywords":"","body":"User Management and Access Control\nRoles and Privileges are controlled through the Administration page, under the Manage Users section.\nOpenMRS uses privileges and roles to control access to data within the system. Privileges define what can or cannot be done in the system (e.g., Edit Patients or Add Users), while roles are used to group privileges into more manageable groupings. To make the system easier to manage, roles can contain other roles as well as privileges. Roles inherit all the privileges of their parent roles.\nWe will use this example: you are working with several privileges related to patient data—e.g., View Patients, Edit Patients, and Add Patients. TheView Patientsprivilege lets users look at patients in the system, the Edit Patients privilege lets users edit information about existing patients, and the Add Patients privilege allows users to create a completely new patient record within the system.\nNow imagine that you need to assign the proper rules to three people: Mary the Medical Student, Bob the Data Assistant, and Erica the Data Manager. You want medical students to be able to view patients, but not edit or add them. Data assistants should be able to not only view, but also edit patient data. And you want your data managers to be able to create new patients within your system.\nDesigning role and privilege schemes\nIn order to give these privileges to the relevant users, you must define a role for each of these types of user.\n\n  \n    \n      Role\n      Privilege(s)\n    \n    \n      \n        Medical Student\n      \n      \n        View Patients\n      \n    \n    \n      Data Assistant\n      \n        View Patients\n        Edit Patients\n      \n    \n    \n      Data Manager\n      \n        View Patients\n        Edit Patients\n        Add Patients\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNow, by defining the main roles for users of your system and assigning users to those roles, you have a much easier system to manage and users will automatically inherit all privileges given to their role(s). Of course, some users will have multiple roles. Now, let's take this process one step further. While it may not seem necessary in this simple example, as your system grows, you will likely end up with a large number of different roles. Very often, certain roles can be defined as a combination of other roles. In our example, a Data Manager oversees the Data Assistants and therefore should have all of their privileges plus some additional privileges. So, let's redesign our roles slightly to show how this might work.\n\n  \n    \n      Role\n      Inherit Privileges from Role(s)\n      Additional Privilege(s)\n    \n    \n      \n        Medical Student\n      \n      \n      \n        View Patient\n      \n    \n    \n      Data Assistant\n      \n      \n        View Patient\n        Edit Patient\n      \n    \n    \n      Data Manager\n      \n        Data Assistant\n      \n      \n        Add Patient\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nYou can see that the Data Manager role can be more clearly defined as a Data Assistant with the extra ability to add patients to the system. In addition, if you should change or enhance the privileges of the Data Assistant role at any time in the future, the Data Manager will automatically adapt to those changes — for example, if you decided a month later to allow any Data Assistant to Edit Encounters (by adding the Edit Encounters privilege to the Data Assistant role), the Data Manager role would automatically gain the ability to edit encounters as well.\nIn a common deployment scenario, you will have several roles that use the same privileges with only a few differences. It is simpler to manage these privileges by defining a new role from which the others can all inherit. For example, you may have roles like Clinician, Data Assistant, and Caregiver  that all have the same rules about viewing patient data.  You might benefit from creating a new Patient Data Viewer role, assigning it to each of those other roles, and then managing the privileges in one place (under that new role).  When there is a policy change about viewing patient data, or a new module is added that adds new functions for viewing data, you would update the Patient Data Viewer role. All the inheriting roles would automatically use the new settings.\nBuilt-in roles\nThere are some special roles that are predefined within OpenMRS and cannot be deleted: Anonymous, Authenticated, and System Developer. Any privileges granted to the Anonymous role will be available to people without logging into the system. Generally, Anonymous privileges should be kept very restricted, since patient information might otherwise be compromised. Privileges granted to the Authenticated role are granted to anyone that logs into your system, no matter what other role(s) they might be assigned. Granting privileges to the Authenticated role is an easy way to grant privileges to all users of the system. The System Developer role is automatically granted full access to the system and should only be granted to system administrators.\nSuper users (system administrators) are automatically granted all privileges in the system; therefore, you must be very careful to protect your system administrator password.\nSome privileges are built into the system and cannot be deleted. Other privileges may be added by modules. It is unlikely that you will be adding new privileges yourself, since privileges are only useful when they are understood and used by the system. On the other hand, you will definitely be creating new roles to fit your needs and will be managing privileges within those roles.\nCreating roles\nYou create roles through Administration > Manage Roles.\n\n\nAllows to add a new role\n\nLists all roles present in the system\n\nClick a role to edit it.\n\n\nIf you then follow the Add Role link, you will see a form for adding a new role.\n\n\nEnter Role Name\n\nChoose Roles Privileges of which you want to inherit\n\nChoose Privileges which you want this Role to have\n\n\nCreating users\nTo create these users, we'll go through Administration > Manage Users. This page also lets you find and edit existing users.\n\n\nCreate a new User\n\nSearch Users by Name or Roles\n\nSearch results\n\nEdit a single User\n\n\nUsers in OpenMRS need to be associated with Persons. You either need to create a new Person, or attach the user account to an existing one.\n\nIn both cases you will be taken to the same Add/Edit User screen. (If you selected an existing person, the fields in the Demographic Info section will be filled out for you.)\n\nManaging Providers\nFor every Encounter you must enter one or more Providers, the person who provided the care or services. Forms usually include a dropdown box to select a provider.\nThe system administrator must explicitly identify Providers. This is done through Administration > Providers > Manage Providers.\nThere are two kinds of providers. In OpenMRS 1.8 and earlier, a provider had to be associated with a user or, less often, a patient. The administrator had to create a user, and then search for them with the Person dropdown box. This is most useful when a provider has a user login. \nAt many OpenMRS sites, only a few users log into the system. Often, treatment notes are entered by data clerks after an encounter, and clinicians never log in. Perhaps there are hundreds of providers who volunteer at the clinic only briefly. From OpenMRS 1.9 on, these providers can be entered as a name, and a user login is not required.\nFor system security, patient privacy, and ease of maintenance, it's best to enter providers only as a Provider Name when possible. You should create a user if the provider needs to log in or be given special permissions through a role. You can assign a user to a provider at a later time if it becomes necessary.\nTo create a Provider, go to Admin > Manage Providers and click Add Provider.\n\nThe identifier is a unique word or number that you provide.  It's recommended that you create identifiers in a way that's simple and easy, such as using the provider's last name and first name.\nNext, decide if this provider will be associated with a Person, or only be entered as a provider name.  If you choose the Person style, you must have already created a User for them. Begin typing their name in the Person field, and select them from the auto-complete list of matching users. For a Provider who is simply a Provider Name, enter their name in the Provider Name field.  \nClick Save to save the provider. \n"},"Administering OpenMRS/maintenance.html":{"url":"Administering OpenMRS/maintenance.html","title":"Maintenance","keywords":"","body":"Maintenance\nOpenMRS server room in Webuye, Kenya.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured OpenMRS and it is being used to support day-to-day clinical operations, there is still work to be done. To ensure the system runs smoothly and error-free, use the following tips as a starting point to create a maintenance plan for your OpenMRS installation. We recommend documenting this plan and reviewing it regularly.\nServer management\nAlthough outside the scope of this book, it is important to keep both your OpenMRS server(s) and client systems updated with the latest security patches. In Windows, you should use the Windows Update tool to review and install critical system updates. If you use Linux, use either apt-get upgrade or yum update, depending on what distribution of Linux you use.\nBefore upgrading MySQL, Java, or Apache Tomcat (and of course, OpenMRS) you should check with the OpenMRS community to see how those upgrades might effect how OpenMRS runs on your server. See the \"Getting Help\" section for more information.\nYou should also periodically check to ensure your server has plenty of free disk space. Additionally, if you are running a Windows server, ensure your system has anti-virus software installed and it is up-to-date.\nBackups\nYou should ensure your system has a backup strategy. Much has been written on this subject and general knowledge about backups is beyond the scope of this book. However, there are some specific items to consider when backing up your OpenMRS server.\nMost importantly, you need to create a backup strategy for your MySQL database. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is by using the mysqldump utility that ships with the database. Ideally, you will want to shut down OpenMRS before backing up, and restart it once the backup has completed. If you are not able to do so, or wish to have the system remain in a \"read-only\" mode, you may want to use the options of mysqldump to lock tables. Consult the MySQL documentation for details.\nYou should also ensure you are backing up the .OpenMRS directory. This directory, which stores modules and configuration files, is stored in the home directory of the user that runs the Tomcat server on Windows or Linux.\nPerformance tuning\nOver the past several years, implementers of OpenMRS around the world have compiled information about improving the performance of their systems. There are several components of the system that may need to be tuned to ensure optimal performance. Please use the information in the following sections as a guide and a starting point -- you will need to explore what settings work best for your system.\nOpenMRS settings\nNote:From version 1.9 and above, \"global properties\" will be referred to as \"settings\" in the guide.\nYou may need to adjust some settings in OpenMRS. To do this, use the Maintenance > Advanced Settings page under the OpenMRS Administration section, find the desired setting and clear or change its value as described in the following tips, then click the Save button at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nClear out the patient.identifierRegex setting to disable regular expression identifier searches.\n\nClear out the patient.identifierPrefix and patient.identifierSuffix settings to disable \"like\" identifier searches.\n\nMake sure that the dashboard.regimen.displayDrugSetIds setting has concept ID numbers and not names. In other words, use \"1085,1159\" instead of \"ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS,TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT DRUGS\".\n\nSet the searchWidget.batchSize, searchWidget.runInSerialMode and searchWidget.searchDelayInterval settings to tune your searches for better performance and suit your implementation's environment. You may wish to consider the speed of your network connection, typing skills and average number of simultaneous users on a typical work day. You might also consider reducing the value of the settings person.searchMaxResults and searchWidget.batchSize to reduce the load on the search widgets and server for better performance.\n\n\nApache Tomcat\nTomcat has several settings that may be adjusted to optimize its use of memory:\n\nExperience has shown it is best to install Tomcat from the download section at http://tomcat.apache.org/ rather than any other source. If using Ubuntu Linux, we do not recommend using the apt-get installer.\n\nIncrease the amount of memory allocated for Tomcat. Depending on how you start or run Tomcat, use one of the following methods:\n\nIf running Tomcat from the command line, add the following parameters:\n-Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m\n\nIf running Tomcat as a Windows service, launch the Tomcat Monitor application. Go to Configure > Java > Java Options and add the following to the listed settings:\n-Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m\n\nIf running Tomcat as a Linux service, edit the /etc/init.d/tomcat (or equivalent) script and modify the line for CATALINA_OPTS to read as follows:\nCATALINA_OPTS=\"-Djava.library.path=/opt/tomcat/lib/.libs  -Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m  -XX:NewSize=128m\"\n\n\n\nAdjust Tomcat to prevent potential memory leaks. Tomcat has a default setting that often causes memory leaks. To turn it off, open the configuration file.\n\n/conf/web.xml\n\nIn JSP servlet definition add the following element:\n\nenablePooling\nfalse\n\n\n\nExperiment with better garbage collection in Tomcat to prevent PermGen out of memory errors. To use a newer version of Tomcat garbage collection, you need to add the following to CATALINA_OPTS, as was shown above in the previous step.\n\n\nMySQL\nOptimizing MySQL database settings will help OpenMRS to run more efficiently, especially as your installation grows in the size of data you are storing.\nIncrease theinnodb_buffer_pool_size. It is the size in bytes of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of its tables. The larger you set this value, the less disk I/O is needed to access data in tables. On a dedicated database server, you may set this to up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. However, do not set it too large because competition for physical memory might cause paging in the operating system. Modify the following in MySQL'smy.inifile, or add it if it is not present.\nmax_allowed_packet=64M\nIncrease themax_allowed_packet size. When MySQL attempts to work with a packet of data larger than specified, it causes apacket too largeerror and closes the connection, causing OpenMRS to stop working. Increasing this value allows MySQL to handle larger sets of data. Modify the following in MySQL'smy.inifile, or add it if it is not present.\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size=3G\nYou may also consider running a MySQL performance-tuning script and making adjustments to your MySQL configuration file based on its suggestions. One such script is available here:\nhttps://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Performance+Tuning\nReplication options\nReplication of your OpenMRS installation across multiple servers or multiple sites is an advanced topic that is outside the scope of this book. However, you should be aware that several options exist if you require access to your OpenMRS data from alternate locations.\nMySQL replication\nThe MySQL database offers methods for replicating your database across multiple servers, meaning it is possible to have multiple synchronized copies of your OpenMRS data. Please consult the MySQL documentation for details. If you point an identically-configured OpenMRS server at this replicated database, you will have a mirrored instance of OpenMRS. It is important to ensure that if you make changes to the primary system, those same changes take place on all servers.\nSync module\nAnother option is available for OpenMRS installations with multiple sites. The community-developed Sync module is available from the OpenMRS module repository, and allows data to be synchronized across a network (or external data storage) using tools within OpenMRS itself. Please search the OpenMRS Wiki for more information about the Sync module.\nUpgrading OpenMRS\nThe OpenMRS implementer and developer communities provide application and customization support via mailing lists, IRC, and other means. See \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\" for more information.\nWhen the development team release a new upgrade for OpenMRS, they will provide either a new version of the OpenMRS Standalone installer or the OpenMRS Enterprise installer file to run on your server. If using the Standalone version, follow the upgrade instructions included with the application. If using the Enterprise version, you should be able to undeploy the OpenMRS webapp in Apache Tomcat, and deploy the new version.\nBe sure to test any upgrades on a server other than the primary server you use for normal clinical support. Always be sure to back up your system before upgrading.\nUpdating modules\nSupported community-developed OpenMRS modules are regularly updated, and those new versions are published in the OpenMRS module repository. You should check for upgraded modules regularly. Go to http://modules.openmrs.org/ or view the \"Manage Modules\" page from the OpenMRS Administration page. From there, you can upgrade a module with updates automatically by clicking Install Update, or you may manually upload the new version by following the instructions on the page.\nAmani's maintenance plan\n\nAs part of his responsibilities as ICT infrastructure manager for the clinic, Daniel created a written maintenance plan. In this document, he has included daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. The only daily task is an automated one -- Daniel created a script on his Ubuntu server to stop OpenMRS, backup MySQL and other OpenMRS files, and restart the application. This script runs overnight while the clinic is closed. Weekly, Claudine manually checks the disk space and runs apt-get upgrade to update system components. Every month, Claudine checks the OpenMRS web site for OpenMRS upgrades and upgrades to the modules the clinic uses.\n"},"Administering OpenMRS/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"Administering OpenMRS/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Troubleshooting Your Installation\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes things do not go exactly planned. This chapter can help you deal with the most common problems.\nWe recommend using Apache Tomcat 6.0.29 to run OpenMRS. Any J2EE-compliant Java servlet container should be able to run it, but most people who use OpenMRS are running it with Tomcat, which may make it easier to get support if you encounter problems.\nIf you are not yet using Tomcat 6.0.29, consider upgrading Tomcat before you continue. We recommend getting Tomcat from this link.\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/\nWhen troubleshooting Tomcat, your first step should always be to review the Tomcat logs. In Windows, these are stored at the following location.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Tomcat 6.0\\logs\n\nHistorically, MySQL has been recommended as the database of choice to use with OpenMRS. The newer database from the open source project MariaDB should also be compatible with OpenMRS. Work is underway in the OpenMRS community to provide support for other databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and others, but these databases are not yet supported.\nYou may not be able to resolve your problem with OpenMRS using the troubleshooting material in this chapter. That is OK -- the OpenMRS community is available to help! Check out the Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community chapter for more information about how to communicate with others, ask questions, and get answers.\nSome possible problems and solutions\nOpenMRS fails to install with message \"Error creating bean with name 'messageSourceServiceTarget'\"\nMySQL must be running before starting and installing OpenMRS. If it is not, you may see the following error message in your web browser and log files when you attempt to install OpenMRS:\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException:Error creating bean with name 'messageSourceServiceTarget' defined in class path resource applicationContext-service.xml\nEnsure MySQL is installed and running before attempting to start and install OpenMRS. \nMySQL Configure Instance hangs on starting the service, or reports Error 1045\nOn Windows, the computer may stop responding while running the MySQL Configure Instance tool. Most commonly, this occurs before the tool marks Starting the service as complete, because there is already a MySQL service running. \nTo fix this, you should delete the pre-existing MySQL service in Windows, and try the installation again. You can find instructions on how to do delete a MySQL service at this link.\nAlternatively, you may see a MySQL Error 1045, if your computer has previously had a MySQL instance installed. This means that the root password is incorrect, and is most commonly caused by residual data from the previous installation.\nTo fix this, you should delete the MySQL data directory. On Windows 7, you may need to reboot and delete the directory, or to use an unlocking program in order to delete this directory.\nYou can also change the password that OpenMRS uses to access your MySQL database, by editing the openmrs-runtime.properties file, as described later in this chapter.\nStarting Tomcat service on Windows fails\nIf you cannot start the Tomcat service on Windows, try checking the Tomcat logs. You can find the logs in the following directory.\n\n\\logs\n\nErrors like \"Failed creating java C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.6.0\\bin\\client\\jvm.dll\"\nTo fix this problem, search for msvcr71.dll on your hard drive, and copy that file to this location.\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32 \n\nInstalling OpenMRS or running database updates fails with message “Could not acquire change log lock”\nTo prevent conflicting updates, liquibase begins each update by creating a row in the liquibasechangeloglock table. This row acts as a lock. If OpenMRS or Apache Tomcat crashes while an update is in progress, the update may fail to complete\nand this row will not be removed from the table.\nYou may see the following error message in your web browser or in the Tomcat logs, the next time you start up or attempt to install or update OpenMRS:\n\"Error Could not acquire change log lock\"\nDeleting this row from the liquibasechangeloglock table will solve the problem, and allow installation or updates to proceed normally. To delete rows from the liquibasechangeloglock table using a command line SQL client, run either of the following SQL commands:\ntruncate table liquibasechangeloglock;\ndelete from liquibasechangeloglock;\nIf you prefer to use a GUI client for MySQL, you should navigate to the liquibasechangeloglock table and delete all rows from that table. When you have cleared the table, restart Tomcat if necessary, and restart OpenMRS.\nProblems connecting to Tomcat on port 8080\nOther installed programs may already be using port 8080. This will prevent Tomcat using this port. Some software may also use port 8005, which should not interfere with running Tomcat, but may prevent it from starting up correctly.\nIf you know what program is using these ports, you may choose to stop or remove that program. Alternatively, you can configure Tomcat to run on a different port by editing Tomcat’s server.xml file to change 8080 to a different value (eg 8090).\nIf you need further help, see the \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\" chapter for more information.\nPermission problems when running Tomcat as a service on Ubuntu\nIf you are trying to run Tomcat as a server on Ubuntu, you may run into permission issues. The following error is typical of these problems:\njava.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission /usr/share/tomcat6/webapps/openmrs/WEB-INF/dwr-modules.xml delete)\nThe easiest way to solve this issue is to disable the Java security manager or similar startup script, which you can find at this location.\n\n/etc/init.d/tomcat6\n\nEdit the file and set TOMCAT6_SECURITY to no.\n# Use the Java security manager? (yes/no)\nTOMCAT6_SECURITY=no\nTomcat stops responding after updating or reloading OpenMRS in the Web Application Manager\nTomcat and the JVM allocate memory to a webapp each time you use the Update or Reload functions in the Web Application Manager. When the app is destroyed or recreated, some of this memory may not be released. If you update or reload the webapp too many times, Tomcat may run out of allocated memory, and will stop responding. You will also see the following error in the Tomcat logs:\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\nIt is not possible to completely avoid this problem. However you can mitigate it by allowing Tomcat to use more memory, or by restarting Tomcat if you have to repeatedly update or reload a webapp.\nDeploying OpenMRS using the Tomcat Manager web application fails\nFor various reasons, trying to deploy OpenMRS using the Tomcat Manager web application may fail. If this occurs, you should undeploy OpenMRS using the Tomcat Manager, then stop Tomcat.\nYou can do this on the command line under Linux or OS X. First, find the process ID (PID) by running the following command:\nps ax | grep tomcat\nThis may return several lines, each starting with a number. Look for a long line that contains something like /usr/local/tomcat or /opt/tomcat. The PID is the first number on that line. Stop Tomcat with the following command:\nkill -9 PID\nFinally, you can restart Tomcat as follows:\nservice tomcat6 start\nLog back into the Tomcat Manager web application and deploy OpenMRS normally.\nOpenMRS (openmrs.war) deploys successfully but fails to start\nIf there are issues with the OpenMRS settings for application_data_directory, openmrs.war may successfully deploy, but then fail to start. The following messages are seen in Tomcat's logs:\nSEVERE: Error listenerStart\nSEVERE: Context [/openmrs] startup failed due to previous errors\nEnsure that the runtime properties file exists, and that the application_data_directory is specified in this file. Then ensure that the directory exists, and that Tomcat has read and write permissions to the directory.\nIf the directory exists as specified in the runtime properties file and Tomcat has the appropriate permissions, you may have security violation problems in your Tomcat configuration. If you need further advice, consider seeking help from the community, as described in the chapter \"Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community\".\nUnable to log in to Tomcat Manager due to lost password\nThe Tomcat admin password is required to log in to the Tomcat Manager web application, and to deploy and undeploy applications, including OpenMRS.\nIf you have forgotten, lost, or misplaced this password, you can retrieve it from the file tomcat-users.xml. On Windows, this is probably located at this location.\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Tomcat 6.0\\conf\\\n\nThe database password or other properties are set incorrectly\nIf you have installed the OpenMRS Standalone application, you can modify settings by editing the openmrs-standalone-runtime.properties file in the directory where you extracted the ZIP package.\nTo modify settings for the OpenMRS Enterprise version, you should edit the file openmrs-runtime.properties. You should find this file in one of the following locations:\nOn Windows systems:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\YOURUSERNAME\\Application Data\\OpenMRS\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\Application Data\\OpenMRS\n\n\nOn Mac OS X or Linux systems:\n\n~/YOURUSERNAME/.OpenMRS\n\n/usr/share/tomcatX/.OpenMRS\n\n\nThe OpenMRS administrator account password has been forgotten\nIn general, when a user is locked out, the password should be reset by the administrator using the \"Edit User\" page from the OpenMRS Administration page. In rare situations in which the administrator's account has been forgotten, the only way to reset the password is to directly modify the OpenMRS database. This should only be attempted by advanced users, and you should always back up your database before making changes.\nYou will need to modify the users table in the OpenMRS database schema. Find the row for the user in question and change the password and salt values to the following:\n\npassword: 4a1750c8607d0fa237de36c6305715c223415189\n\nsalt: c788c6ad82a157b712392ca695dfcf2eed193d7f   \n\n\nSome module pages throw java.lang.ClassNotFoundException\nThere are currently some issues with compatibility between OpenMRS and versions of Apache Tomcat later than 6.0.29. OpenMRS modules that rely on certain custom expression language functions will throw ajava.lang.ClassNotFoundException exception.\nIf you encounter this issue using a version of Tomcat greater than v6.0.29, you may need to disable any modules that rely on custom expression language functions, or install Tomcat 6.0.29 for use with OpenMRS.\nStarting OpenMRS fails with message “Module file does not have the correct .omod file extension”\nOpenMRS will not start if there are non-modules in the modules directory. You may find a message in the logs similar to these:\norg.openmrs.module.ModuleException: Module file does not have the correct .omod file extension Module: derby.log\norg.openmrs.module.ModuleException: Module file does not have the correct .omod file extension Module: velocity.log\nTo solve this problem, delete or move any files in the modules directory that are not modules with an.omodextension. \nIn particular, the BIRT Runtime creates various log files in the modules directory when the BIRT module is stopped. If you are using the BIRT Report module, there may be non-module files in the OpenMRS modules directory--typically, derby.log or velocity.log. These files can safely be moved to another location or deleted.\nTo prevent thederby.logfrom being created in future, delete the directory org.apache.derby.core_10.1.2.1 which is located under the following directory. \n\nbirt-runtime-2_2_0/ReportEngine/plugins/\n\nMySQL packet length errors, or MySQL Error 2006\nThese errors occur when the client or server tries to handle data larger than the maximum packet length. The default maximum packet length is 1MB. Some items (such as form data) can easily exceed this maximum, causing errors when importing data into or exporting data from the OpenMRS database.\nTo increase the maximum packet length allowed by your MySQL server, you should stop the server, edit the configuration file, then restart the server. The configuration file is typically located at one of these locations.\n\nWindows: C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server x.x\\my.ini\n\nLinux or Mac OS X: /etc/my.cnf\n\n\nThis file should already contain a section with the header [archive:mysqld]. You can add the following line below that header:\nmax_allowed_packet=64M\nYou can also increase the maximum packet length using the MySQL Administrator application, by opening the Health section and changing the max_allowed_packet setting on the System Variables tab. This setting can be increased up to a maximum of 1024M as necessary.\nDepending on your MySQL client, you may also need to adjust the maximum packet length of the client. If you are using the MySQL command line client, you can start it with an increased max_allowed_packet by adding the following after the MySQL command:\n--max_allowed_packet=64M\nProblems connecting to MySQL on a system with multiple MySQL installations\nIf MySQL is already installed and running on your system, OpenMRS Standalone's initial setup may be unable to create the OpenMRS user and database. You may also encounter this problem after installation, if you have installed a \"traditional\" MySQL server and try to run OpenMRS Standalone.\nThis problem happens because MySQL clients on UNIX-based systems always use UNIX sockets to connect to MySQL when localhost is specified in the connection URL. This is a known issue/limitation/bug in MySQL and is documented in more detail by the MySQL project.\nhttp://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31577\nIt is possible to run OpenMRS in a separate database instance than the one already existing on your system (for example, to run OpenMRS Standalone on a system where MySQL is already installed). To do so, you must first ensure that the new database instance is running on a different port.\nThen, ensure that you are connecting to MySQL via TCP/IP instead of using the same UNIX socket as the existing instance. The easiest way to do this is to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost in the connection string. An alternative is to add &server.port=XXXX to the value of connection.url in the openmrs-runtime.properties file, where XXXX is the port used by the OpenMRS MySQL instance.\nFor example, if the MySQL instance used by OpenMRS is running on port 4242, the openmrs-runtime.properties file should include one of the following lines:\nconnection.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:4242/openmrs?autoReconnect=true&sessionVariables=storage_engine=InnoDB&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8\nconnection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:4242/openmrs?autoReconnect=true&sessionVariables=storage_engine=InnoDB&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&server.port=4242\nTomcat error log contains IOException while loading persisted sessions\nApache Tomcat tries to restore the exact memory state after each restart. OpenMRS does not depend on this feature, so you can ignore any warnings printed to the Tomcat logs that look similar to the following:\nSEVERE: IOException while loading persisted sessions: java.io.WriteAbortedException: writing aborted; java.io.NotSerializableException:\nIf you find these messages annoying, you can turn off session persistence. Edit the /conf/server.xml file and uncomment the line that includes:\n\nJava Heap Size errors\nOpenMRS uses a lot of memory for caching. Certain tasks, such as exporting data, may cause a Java Heap Size error. You can mitigate this by increasing the default memory allocation in Tomcat.\nIf you are starting Tomcat on the command line, you should pass the following parameters to increase the default memory allocation: \n-Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m\nIf you are running Tomcat as a Windows Service, you can increase the memory allocation by adding this same line to the list of start parameters. Make sure that you add this to the end of the existing parameters exactly. An extra space at the end of the line can prevent Tomcat from starting properly. You can find the list of start parameters in the Tomcat Monitor application, by going to Configure Tomcat > Java > Java Options, or via the Control Panel > Services > Apache Tomcat > Properties > Start Parameters. \nIf you are running a 64-bit version of Tomcat as a Windows Service, you must edit the Windows Registry to add that line to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Apache Software Foundation\\Procrun 2.0\\Tomcat5\\Parameters\\JavaJVM settings in the Registry.\nIf you are running Tomcat on Ubuntu, edit its startup script such as /etc/init.d/tomcat6 and make the following changes:\nif [ -z \"$JAVA_OPTS\" ]; then\n        JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx128M\"\nfi\nif [ -z \"$JAVA_OPTS\" ]; then\n        JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m\"\nfi\nIf you are running Tomcat as a Linux service, open the /etc/init.d/tomcat script and append change the CATALINA_OPTS variable:\nCATALINA_OPTS=\"-Djava.library.path=/opt/tomcat/lib/.libs -Xmx512m -Xms512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:NewSize=128m\"\nMemory leaks\nAfter troubleshooting, you may determine that Tomcat or OpenMRS is having problems with memory leaks.\nTo mitigate memory leak problems in Tomcat, consider enabling pooling by adding the following element to the JSP servlet definition in the file /conf/web.xml:\nenablePoolingfalse\nIf you believe you have discovered a memory leak in OpenMRS and are comfortable looking at the OpenMRS application code to identify where the leak is located, you may like to troubleshoot further to find out the cause. OpenMRS developers use YourKit Profiler to discover and debug memory and CPU consumption issues. \nYourKit is kindly supporting members of the OpenMRS community with its full-featured Java Profiler product.
